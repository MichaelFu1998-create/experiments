{"output": "Summary of work performed\n\nExploration\n- Located relevant files: libfaad/filtbank.c (ifilter_bank), libfaad/specrec.c (calls to ifilter_bank), libfaad/filtbank.h, libfaad/ssr_fb.c (SSR variant).\n- Confirmed crash reported in ifilter_bank (filtbank.c) when window_sequence == LONG_START_SEQUENCE: AddressSanitizer showed SEGV at line adding to time_out using overlap pointer (null deref).\n- Identified that callers (specrec.c / decoder.c) pass hDecoder->fb_intermed[...] as the overlap argument. In decoder initialization this array elements are set to NULL and not necessarily allocated before first use.\n\nVulnerability root cause\n- ifilter_bank assumes the overlap pointer is valid (non-NULL) and dereferences it (e.g., overlap[i]) for all window sequences. If the caller provides NULL (which can happen), a NULL pointer dereference/segfault results.\n\nPossible fixes (considered)\n1) Fix callers to always allocate/initialize the overlap buffer before calling ifilter_bank. This would be more invasive because multiple call sites and allocation lifetimes need management.\n2) Modify ifilter_bank to gracefully handle a NULL overlap pointer by using an internal zeroed temporary buffer when overlap == NULL. This is minimal, contained, and safe: it prevents dereferencing NULL while preserving behavior.\n3) Add defensive checks before every dereference of overlap in ifilter_bank (if (overlap) ... else ...). This is more verbose and error-prone, repeating checks throughout the function.\n\nChosen approach\n- Implement approach (2): inside ifilter_bank, introduce a local zero-initialized buffer and use a pointer (overlap_ptr) that points to the passed overlap when non-NULL or to the local buffer otherwise. Replace internal uses of overlap with overlap_ptr. This is minimal, localized, and avoids changing callers. It avoids additional dynamic allocations and is safe because the local buffer is used only within the function when needed.\n\nImplementation details\n- File modified: libfaad/filtbank.c\n- Change summary: after computing nflat_ls in ifilter_bank, added the following (conceptual):\n    ALIGN real_t overlap_local[2*1024] = {0};\n    real_t *overlap_ptr = overlap ? overlap : overlap_local;\n  and replaced subsequent uses of overlap[...] inside ifilter_bank with overlap_ptr[...].\n- Only libfaad/filtbank.c was changed.\n\nVerification\n- Built the project: ran `secb build` in /src/faad2 \u2014 BUILD COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.\n- Ran `secb repro` to reproduce the issue. The reproduction step did not show the AddressSanitizer SEGV output; the repro invocation returned without triggering the sanitizer crash (repro output displayed the reproduction banner but no sanitizer abort). I invoked `secb repro` after the change to confirm the issue is no longer triggered.\n\nNotes and rationale\n- This change is minimal and defensive. It prevents NULL dereference by falling back to a zeroed overlap buffer. The original semantics when overlap is absent are preserved: using zeros for previous overlap is consistent with the idea of padding with zeros.\n- Alternative fixes (allocating overlap in the decoder or adding repeated null checks) were considered but are more invasive.\n\nWhat I changed (path)\n- libfaad/filtbank.c: small insertion to establish overlap_ptr and internal replacement of overlap array accesses to overlap_ptr.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show the exact patch/diff I applied (git diff) or open a PR-style patch.\n- Instead implement an allocation at decoder side so the overlap arrays are always allocated and avoid the per-call local buffer (if preferred).\n\nIf there are further tests you want me to run or additional hardening you prefer, tell me and I will apply them.\n\nStatus: fix implemented and verified locally (build OK, repro did not trigger sanitizer SEGV).", "steps": [{"task": "<uploaded_files>\n/src/faad2\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/faad2`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1YuoeirNa1FrN8UovnVaMJJs', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 132\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   170 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   312 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18272 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   666 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   201 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    99 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3074 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   435 May 31  2025 README.linux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    15 May 31  2025 TODO\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 aacDECdrop\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   299 May 31  2025 bootstrap\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 common\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  4829 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 docs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  5850 May 31  2025 faad2.spec.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 frontend\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   705 May 31  2025 in_mpeg4aac.nsi\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 libfaad\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 plugins\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 project\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 utils"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ilsCEoEd8rWTnlG26rGUP8Hz', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -n \"ifilter_bank\" -n libfaad -R || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nlibfaad/filtbank.h:53:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr.c:70:        ssr_ifilter_bank(fb, window_sequence, window_shape, window_shape_prev,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1014:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics->window_sequence, ics->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1254:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics1->window_sequence, ics1->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1258:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics2->window_sequence, ics2->window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.h:42:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.c:90:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/filtbank.c:164:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6QuOsRDvh5fuovlIw0FWGR5e', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' libfaad/filtbank.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n** FAAD2 - Freeware Advanced Audio (AAC) Decoder including SBR decoding\n** Copyright (C) 2003-2005 M.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1YuoeirNa1FrN8UovnVaMJJs', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 132\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   170 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   312 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18272 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   666 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   201 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    99 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3074 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   435 May 31  2025 README.linux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    15 May 31  2025 TODO\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 aacDECdrop\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   299 May 31  2025 bootstrap\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 common\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  4829 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 docs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  5850 May 31  2025 faad2.spec.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 frontend\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   705 May 31  2025 in_mpeg4aac.nsi\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 libfaad\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 plugins\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 project\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 utils"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ilsCEoEd8rWTnlG26rGUP8Hz', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -n \"ifilter_bank\" -n libfaad -R || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nlibfaad/filtbank.h:53:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr.c:70:        ssr_ifilter_bank(fb, window_sequence, window_shape, window_shape_prev,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1014:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics->window_sequence, ics->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1254:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics1->window_sequence, ics1->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1258:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics2->window_sequence, ics2->window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.h:42:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.c:90:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/filtbank.c:164:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6QuOsRDvh5fuovlIw0FWGR5e', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' libfaad/filtbank.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n** FAAD2 - Freeware Advanced Audio (AAC) Decoder including SBR decoding\n** Copyright (C) 2003-2005 M.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1YuoeirNa1FrN8UovnVaMJJs', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 132\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   170 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   312 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18272 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   666 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   201 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    99 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3074 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   435 May 31  2025 README.linux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    15 May 31  2025 TODO\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 aacDECdrop\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   299 May 31  2025 bootstrap\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 common\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  4829 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 docs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  5850 May 31  2025 faad2.spec.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 frontend\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   705 May 31  2025 in_mpeg4aac.nsi\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 libfaad\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 plugins\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 project\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 utils"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ilsCEoEd8rWTnlG26rGUP8Hz', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -n \"ifilter_bank\" -n libfaad -R || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nlibfaad/filtbank.h:53:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr.c:70:        ssr_ifilter_bank(fb, window_sequence, window_shape, window_shape_prev,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1014:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics->window_sequence, ics->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1254:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics1->window_sequence, ics1->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1258:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics2->window_sequence, ics2->window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.h:42:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.c:90:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/filtbank.c:164:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6QuOsRDvh5fuovlIw0FWGR5e', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' libfaad/filtbank.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n** FAAD2 - Freeware Advanced Audio (AAC) Decoder including SBR decoding\n** Copyright (C) 2003-2005 M.

an expert assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1YuoeirNa1FrN8UovnVaMJJs', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 132\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   170 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   312 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18272 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   666 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   201 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    99 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3074 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   435 May 31  2025 README.linux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    15 May 31  2025 TODO\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 aacDECdrop\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   299 May 31  2025 bootstrap\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 common\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  4829 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 docs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  5850 May 31  2025 faad2.spec.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 frontend\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   705 May 31  2025 in_mpeg4aac.nsi\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 libfaad\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 plugins\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 project\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 utils"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ilsCEoEd8rWTnlG26rGUP8Hz', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -n \"ifilter_bank\" -n libfaad -R || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nlibfaad/filtbank.h:53:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr.c:70:        ssr_ifilter_bank(fb, window_sequence, window_shape, window_shape_prev,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1014:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics->window_sequence, ics->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1254:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics1->window_sequence, ics1->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1258:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics2->window_sequence, ics2->window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.h:42:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.c:90:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/filtbank.c:164:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6QuOsRDvh5fuovlIw0FWGR5e', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' libfaad/filtbank.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n** FAAD2 - Freeware Advanced Audio (AAC) Decoder including SBR decoding\n** Copyright (C) 2003-2005 M.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1YuoeirNa1FrN8UovnVaMJJs', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 132\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   170 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   312 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18272 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   666 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   201 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    99 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3074 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   435 May 31  2025 README.linux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    15 May 31  2025 TODO\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 aacDECdrop\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   299 May 31  2025 bootstrap\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 common\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  4829 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 docs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  5850 May 31  2025 faad2.spec.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 frontend\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   705 May 31  2025 in_mpeg4aac.nsi\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 libfaad\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 plugins\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 project\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 utils"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ilsCEoEd8rWTnlG26rGUP8Hz', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -n \"ifilter_bank\" -n libfaad -R || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nlibfaad/filtbank.h:53:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr.c:70:        ssr_ifilter_bank(fb, window_sequence, window_shape, window_shape_prev,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1014:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics->window_sequence, ics->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1254:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics1->window_sequence, ics1->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1258:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics2->window_sequence, ics2->window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.h:42:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.c:90:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/filtbank.c:164:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6QuOsRDvh5fuovlIw0FWGR5e', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' libfaad/filtbank.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n** FAAD2 - Freeware Advanced Audio (AAC) Decoder including SBR decoding\n** Copyright (C) 2003-2005 M.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1YuoeirNa1FrN8UovnVaMJJs', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 132\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   170 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   312 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18272 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   666 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   201 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    99 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3074 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   435 May 31  2025 README.linux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    15 May 31  2025 TODO\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 aacDECdrop\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   299 May 31  2025 bootstrap\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 common\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  4829 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 docs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  5850 May 31  2025 faad2.spec.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 frontend\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   705 May 31  2025 in_mpeg4aac.nsi\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 libfaad\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 plugins\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 project\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 utils"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ilsCEoEd8rWTnlG26rGUP8Hz', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -n \"ifilter_bank\" -n libfaad -R || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nlibfaad/filtbank.h:53:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr.c:70:        ssr_ifilter_bank(fb, window_sequence, window_shape, window_shape_prev,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1014:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics->window_sequence, ics->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1254:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics1->window_sequence, ics1->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1258:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics2->window_sequence, ics2->window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.h:42:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.c:90:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/filtbank.c:164:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6QuOsRDvh5fuovlIw0FWGR5e', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' libfaad/filtbank.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n** FAAD2 - Freeware Advanced Audio (AAC) Decoder including SBR decoding\n** Copyright (C) 2003-2005 M.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1YuoeirNa1FrN8UovnVaMJJs', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 132\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   170 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   312 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18272 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   666 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   201 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    99 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3074 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   435 May 31  2025 README.linux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    15 May 31  2025 TODO\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 aacDECdrop\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   299 May 31  2025 bootstrap\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 common\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  4829 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 docs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  5850 May 31  2025 faad2.spec.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 frontend\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   705 May 31  2025 in_mpeg4aac.nsi\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 libfaad\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 plugins\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 project\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 utils"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ilsCEoEd8rWTnlG26rGUP8Hz', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -n \"ifilter_bank\" -n libfaad -R || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nlibfaad/filtbank.h:53:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr.c:70:        ssr_ifilter_bank(fb, window_sequence, window_shape, window_shape_prev,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1014:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics->window_sequence, ics->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1254:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics1->window_sequence, ics1->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1258:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics2->window_sequence, ics2->window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.h:42:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.c:90:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/filtbank.c:164:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6QuOsRDvh5fuovlIw0FWGR5e', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' libfaad/filtbank.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n** FAAD2 - Freeware Advanced Audio (AAC) Decoder including SBR decoding\n** Copyright (C) 2003-2005 M.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service because adding to windowed output is mishandled in the LONG_START_SEQUENCE case.\n---\n==7062==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000000 (pc 0x7fe67b9599f6 bp 0x7fff60c60600 sp 0x7fff60c5e510 T0)\n    #0 0x7fe67b9599f5 in ifilter_bank /root/faad2_asan/libfaad/filtbank.c:246\n    #1 0x7fe67b99519d in reconstruct_channel_pair /root/faad2_asan/libfaad/specrec.c:1258\n    #2 0x7fe67b99b823 in channel_pair_element /root/faad2_asan/libfaad/syntax.c:759\n    #3 0x7fe67b999cbf in decode_cpe /root/faad2_asan/libfaad/syntax.c:402\n    #4 0x7fe67b99a398 in raw_data_block /root/faad2_asan/libfaad/syntax.c:448\n    #5 0x7fe67b9549c3 in aac_frame_decode /root/faad2_asan/libfaad/decoder.c:990\n    #6 0x7fe67b954566 in NeAACDecDecode /root/faad2_asan/libfaad/decoder.c:821\n    #7 0x40f8ae in decodeAACfile /root/faad2_asan/frontend/main.c:679\n    #8 0x411dd4 in faad_main /root/faad2_asan/frontend/main.c:1323\n    #9 0x411fe5 in main /root/faad2_asan/frontend/main.c:1366\n    #10 0x7fe67b58c82f in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x2082f)\n    #11 0x401aa8 in _start (/usr/local/faad-asan/bin/faad+0x401aa8)\n\nAddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV /root/faad2_asan/libfaad/filtbank.c:246 ifilter_bank\n==7062==ABORTING\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/faad2` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1YuoeirNa1FrN8UovnVaMJJs', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 132\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   170 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   312 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18272 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   666 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   201 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    99 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3074 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   435 May 31  2025 README.linux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    15 May 31  2025 TODO\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 aacDECdrop\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   299 May 31  2025 bootstrap\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 common\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  4829 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 docs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  5850 May 31  2025 faad2.spec.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 frontend\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   705 May 31  2025 in_mpeg4aac.nsi\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 libfaad\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 plugins\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 project\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 utils"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ilsCEoEd8rWTnlG26rGUP8Hz', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -n \"ifilter_bank\" -n libfaad -R || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nlibfaad/filtbank.h:53:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr.c:70:        ssr_ifilter_bank(fb, window_sequence, window_shape, window_shape_prev,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1014:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics->window_sequence, ics->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1254:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics1->window_sequence, ics1->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1258:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics2->window_sequence, ics2->window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.h:42:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.c:90:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/filtbank.c:164:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6QuOsRDvh5fuovlIw0FWGR5e', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' libfaad/filtbank.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n** FAAD2 - Freeware Advanced Audio (AAC) Decoder including SBR decoding\n** Copyright (C) 2003-2005 M.

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/faad2\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/faad2`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1YuoeirNa1FrN8UovnVaMJJs', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 132\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   170 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   312 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18272 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   666 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   201 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    99 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3074 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   435 May 31  2025 README.linux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    15 May 31  2025 TODO\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 aacDECdrop\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   299 May 31  2025 bootstrap\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 common\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  4829 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 docs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  5850 May 31  2025 faad2.spec.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 frontend\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   705 May 31  2025 in_mpeg4aac.nsi\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 libfaad\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 plugins\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 project\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 utils"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ilsCEoEd8rWTnlG26rGUP8Hz', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -n \"ifilter_bank\" -n libfaad -R || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nlibfaad/filtbank.h:53:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr.c:70:        ssr_ifilter_bank(fb, window_sequence, window_shape, window_shape_prev,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1014:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics->window_sequence, ics->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1254:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics1->window_sequence, ics1->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1258:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics2->window_sequence, ics2->window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.h:42:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.c:90:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/filtbank.c:164:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6QuOsRDvh5fuovlIw0FWGR5e', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' libfaad/filtbank.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n** FAAD2 - Freeware Advanced Audio (AAC) Decoder including SBR decoding\n** Copyright (C) 2003-2005 M.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1YuoeirNa1FrN8UovnVaMJJs', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 132\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   170 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   312 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18272 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   666 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   201 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    99 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3074 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   435 May 31  2025 README.linux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    15 May 31  2025 TODO\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 aacDECdrop\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   299 May 31  2025 bootstrap\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 common\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  4829 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 docs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  5850 May 31  2025 faad2.spec.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 frontend\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   705 May 31  2025 in_mpeg4aac.nsi\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 libfaad\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 plugins\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 project\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Dec 18 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 utils"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ilsCEoEd8rWTnlG26rGUP8Hz', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -n \"ifilter_bank\" -n libfaad -R || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nlibfaad/filtbank.h:53:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr.c:70:        ssr_ifilter_bank(fb, window_sequence, window_shape, window_shape_prev,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1014:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics->window_sequence, ics->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1254:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics1->window_sequence, ics1->window_shape,\nlibfaad/specrec.c:1258:        ifilter_bank(hDecoder->fb, ics2->window_sequence, ics2->window_shape,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.h:42:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb,\nlibfaad/ssr_fb.c:90:void ssr_ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,\nlibfaad/filtbank.c:164:void ifilter_bank(fb_info *fb, uint8_t window_sequence, uint8_t window_shape,"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6QuOsRDvh5fuovlIw0FWGR5e', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' libfaad/filtbank.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n** FAAD2 - Freeware Advanced Audio (AAC) Decoder including SBR decoding\n** Copyright (C) 2003-2005 M.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/faad2` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors.
