{"output": "Summary of actions, analysis, and fix:\n\nExploration:\n- Located the crash trace in the repository: the sanitizer shows the crash at njs_lvlhsh_find called from njs_object_property (stack: njs_lvlhsh_find -> njs_object_property -> njs_error_to_string2 ...). Files of interest: src/njs/src/njs_lvlhsh.c, src/njs/src/njs_object_prop.c, src/njs/src/njs_error.c, and related headers (src/njs/src/njs_value.h, src/njs/src/njs_object.h).\n- Reviewed njs_lvlhsh.c and njs_object_prop.c. The macro njs_object(value) (in njs_value.h) directly accesses value->data.u.object without checking that value is actually an object (njs_is_object). If njs_object_property() is called with a non-object value, njs_object(value) will dereference fields leading to undefined behavior and the observed crash inside lvlhsh when accessing an invalid object hash pointer.\n\nAnalysis and proposed fixes:\n- Root cause: njs_object_property() assumes its 'value' argument is an object and immediately converts it via the njs_object() macro. If a non-object value gets passed (for example from an error formatting path), that macro dereferences invalid memory, eventually leading to a segfault inside njs_lvlhsh_find.\n\nPossible approaches:\n1) Add a defensive check at the beginning of njs_object_property() to ensure that 'value' is an object (use njs_is_object) and return NJS_DECLINED if not.\n   - Pros: Minimal change, local fix, no ABI changes, prevents dereferencing non-object values.\n   - Cons: Doesn't fix callers passing invalid values, but safely handles them.\n2) Audit all callers and ensure they pass only object values (fix every caller). \n   - Pros: Strict correctness.\n   - Cons: Broad change across many files, more invasive and error-prone in this task scope.\n3) Change the macro njs_object() to be safer (e.g., an inline function validating type).\n   - Pros: Centralized fix.\n   - Cons: Macro used pervasively, changing it may have broad impact and performance implications.\n\nChosen approach:\n- Implement approach (1): add a defensive check at the top of njs_object_property() to validate the argument is an object (using njs_is_object). If not, set retval to undefined and return NJS_DECLINED. This is the smallest, safest change addressing the crash while minimizing scope.\n\nImplementation (minimal change):\n- File changed: src/njs/src/njs_object_prop.c\n- Change made: Inserted check before dereferencing value via njs_object(value):\n\n    if (njs_slow_path(!njs_is_object(value))) {\n        njs_set_undefined(retval);\n        return NJS_DECLINED;\n    }\n\n    object = njs_object(value);\n\n- This ensures subsequent dereference of object is only done for valid object values.\n\nVerification:\n- Ran the project build (secb build) \u2014 build completed successfully.\n- Ran the reproducer (secb repro). Prior to the fix, the reproducer produced AddressSanitizer SEGV at njs_lvlhsh_find. After the change, running the same build+repro no longer triggers the sanitizer SEGV observed previously. (The build and repro commands were executed in the repository; the code change is minimal and focused.)\n\nNotes and recommendations:\n- The change is intentionally minimal and defensive. It avoids dereferencing non-object values in njs_object_property() and therefore prevents the crash path observed.\n- A broader audit of callers could strengthen correctness, and adding unit tests around njs_object_property() with non-object inputs would help prevent regressions.\n\nPatch summary (one-line):\n- src/njs/src/njs_object_prop.c: add njs_is_object check in njs_object_property() before using njs_object(value).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show the exact diff/patch file used.\n- Re-run the build/repro commands and attach their complete outputs.\n\nStatus: I implemented the minimal defensive fix described above. The crash described in the issue (sanitizer SEGV in njs_lvlhsh_find called via njs_object_property) is no longer triggered by the reproducer in this environment.", "steps": [{"task": "<uploaded_files>\n/src/njs\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/njs`.

are an expert assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/njs\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/njs`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

arrays of pointers.\n * The pointers may point to another level, a bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.  The first level is 8K or 4K on 64-bit or 32-bit\n *    platforms respectively.\n *\n * All buckets in a hash are the same size which is a power of 2.\n * A bucket contains several entries stored and tested sequentially.\n * The bucket size should be one or two CPU cache line size, a minimum\n * allowed size is 32 bytes.  A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_count_inc(n)                                               \\\n    n = (void *) ((uintptr_t) (n) + 2)\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_count_dec(n)                                               \\\n    n = (void *) ((uintptr_t) (n) - 2)\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_level_size(proto, nlvl)                                    \\\n    ((uintptr_t) 1 << proto->shift[nlvl])\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_level(lvl, mask)                                           \\\n    (void **) ((uintptr_t) lvl & (~mask << 2))\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_level_entries(lvl, mask)                                   \\\n    ((uintptr_t) lvl & (mask << 1))\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_store_bucket(slot, bkt)                                    \\\n    slot = (void **) ((uintptr_t) bkt | 2 | 1)\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_bucket_size(proto)                                         \\\n    proto->bucket_size\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_bucket(proto, bkt)                                         \\\n    (uint32_t *) ((uintptr_t) bkt & ~(uintptr_t) proto->bucket_mask)\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_bucket_entries(proto, bkt)                                 \\\n    (((uintptr_t) bkt & (uintptr_t) proto->bucket_mask) >> 1)\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_bucket_end(proto, bkt)                                     \\\n    &bkt[proto->bucket_end]\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_free_entry(e)                                              \\\n    (!(njs_lvlhsh_valid_entry(e)))\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_next_bucket(proto, bkt)                                    \\\n    ((void **) &bkt[proto->bucket_end])\n\n#if (NJS_64BIT)\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_valid_entry(e)                                             \\\n    (((e)[0] | (e)[1]) != 0)\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_entry_value(e)                                             \\\n    (void *) (((uintptr_t) (e)[1] << 32) + (e)[0])\n\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_set_entry_value(e, n)                                      \\\n    (e)[0] = (uint32_t)  (uintptr_t) n;

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.  The first level is 8K or 4K on 64-bit or 32-bit\n *    platforms respectively.\n *\n * All buckets in a hash are the same size which is a power of 2.\n * A bucket contains several entries stored and tested sequentially.\n * The bucket size should be one or two CPU cache line size, a minimum\n * allowed size is 32 bytes.  A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/njs\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/njs`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop.

It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.  The first level is 8K or 4K on 64-bit or 32-bit\n *    platforms respectively.\n *\n * All buckets in a hash are the same size which is a power of 2.\n * A bucket contains several entries stored and tested sequentially.\n * The bucket size should be one or two CPU cache line size, a minimum\n * allowed size is 32 bytes.  A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/njs\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/njs`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.  The first level is 8K or 4K on 64-bit or 32-bit\n *    platforms respectively.\n *\n * All buckets in a hash are the same size which is a power of 2.\n * A bucket contains several entries stored and tested sequentially.\n * The bucket size should be one or two CPU cache line size, a minimum\n * allowed size is 32 bytes.  A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

"text", "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/njs\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/njs`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/njs\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/njs`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/njs\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/njs`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.  The first level is 8K or 4K on 64-bit or 32-bit\n *    platforms respectively.\n *\n * All buckets in a hash are the same size which is a power of 2.\n * A bucket contains several entries stored and tested sequentially.\n * The bucket size should be one or two CPU cache line size, a minimum\n * allowed size is 32 bytes.  A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.  The first level is 8K or 4K on 64-bit or 32-bit\n *    platforms respectively.\n *\n * All buckets in a hash are the same size which is a power of 2.\n * A bucket contains several entries stored and tested sequentially.\n * The bucket size should be one or two CPU cache line size, a minimum\n * allowed size is 32 bytes.  A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.  The first level is 8K or 4K on 64-bit or 32-bit\n *    platforms respectively.\n *\n * All buckets in a hash are the same size which is a power of 2.\n * A bucket contains several entries stored and tested sequentially.\n * The bucket size should be one or two CPU cache line size, a minimum\n * allowed size is 32 bytes.  A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

"text", "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.  The first level is 8K or 4K on 64-bit or 32-bit\n *    platforms respectively.\n *\n * All buckets in a hash are the same size which is a power of 2.\n * A bucket contains several entries stored and tested sequentially.\n * The bucket size should be one or two CPU cache line size, a minimum\n * allowed size is 32 bytes.  A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/njs\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/njs`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.  The first level is 8K or 4K on 64-bit or 32-bit\n *    platforms respectively.\n *\n * All buckets in a hash are the same size which is a power of 2.\n * A bucket contains several entries stored and tested sequentially.\n * The bucket size should be one or two CPU cache line size, a minimum\n * allowed size is 32 bytes.  A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/njs\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/njs`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.  The first level is 8K or 4K on 64-bit or 32-bit\n *    platforms respectively.\n *\n * All buckets in a hash are the same size which is a power of 2.\n * A bucket contains several entries stored and tested sequentially.\n * The bucket size should be one or two CPU cache line size, a minimum\n * allowed size is 32 bytes.  A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.  The first level is 8K or 4K on 64-bit or 32-bit\n *    platforms respectively.\n *\n * All buckets in a hash are the same size which is a power of 2.\n * A bucket contains several entries stored and tested sequentially.\n * The bucket size should be one or two CPU cache line size, a minimum\n * allowed size is 32 bytes.  A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop.

This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop.

You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

bucket, or NULL.\n * The levels and buckets must be allocated in manner alike posix_memalign()\n * to bookkeep additional information in pointer low bits.\n *\n * A level is an array of pointers.  Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.  The large data set should be stored using\n * several levels.\n */\n\n#define njs_lvlhsh_is_bucket(p)                                               \\\n    ((uintptr_t) (p) & 1)\n\n\n#define

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/njs` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

Its size is a power of 2.  Levels\n * may be different sizes, but on the same level the sizes are the same.\n * Level sizes are specified by number of bits per level in lvlhsh->shift\n * array.  A hash may have up to 7 levels.  There are two predefined\n * shift arrays given by the first two shift array values:\n *\n * 1) [0, 0]:  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes.\n *\n * 2) [0, 10]: [10, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] on a 64-bit platform or\n *             [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0] on a 32-bit platform,\n *    so default size of levels is 128 bytes on all levels except\n *    the first level.

A default 128-byte bucket contains 10 64-bit\n * entries or 15 32-bit entries.  Each entry consists of pointer to value\n * data and 32-bit key.  If an entry value pointer is NULL, the entry is free.\n * On a 64-bit platform entry value pointers are no aligned, therefore they\n * are accessed as two 32-bit integers.  The rest trailing space in a bucket\n * is used as pointer to next bucket and this pointer is always aligned.\n * Although the level hash allows to store a lot of values in a bucket chain,\n * this is non optimal way.

Files of interest: src/njs/src/njs_lvlhsh.c, src/njs/src/njs_object_prop.c, src/njs/src/njs_error.c, and related headers (src/njs/src/njs_value.h, src/njs/src/njs_object.h).\n- Reviewed njs_lvlhsh.c and njs_object_prop.c. The macro njs_object(value) (in njs_value.h) directly accesses value->data.u.object without checking that value is actually an object (njs_is_object). If njs_object_property() is called with a non-object value, njs_object(value) will dereference fields leading to undefined behavior and the observed crash inside lvlhsh when accessing an invalid object hash pointer.\n\nAnalysis and proposed fixes:\n- Root cause: njs_object_property() assumes its 'value' argument is an object and immediately converts it via the njs_object() macro. If a non-object value gets passed (for example from an error formatting path), that macro dereferences invalid memory, eventually leading to a segfault inside njs_lvlhsh_find.\n\nPossible approaches:\n1) Add a defensive check at the beginning of njs_object_property() to ensure that 'value' is an object (use njs_is_object) and return NJS_DECLINED if not.\n   - Pros: Minimal change, local fix, no ABI changes, prevents dereferencing non-object values.\n   - Cons: Doesn't fix callers passing invalid values, but safely handles them.\n2) Audit all callers and ensure they pass only object values (fix every caller). \n   - Pros: Strict correctness.\n   - Cons: Broad change across many files, more invasive and error-prone in this task scope.\n3) Change the macro njs_object() to be safer (e.g., an inline function validating type).\n   - Pros: Centralized fix.\n   - Cons: Macro used pervasively, changing it may have broad impact and performance implications.\n\nChosen approach:\n- Implement approach (1): add a defensive check at the top of njs_object_property() to validate the argument is an object (using njs_is_object). If not, set retval to undefined and return NJS_DECLINED. This is the smallest, safest change addressing the crash while minimizing scope.\n\nImplementation (minimal change):\n- File changed: src/njs/src/njs_object_prop.c\n- Change made: Inserted check before dereferencing value via njs_object(value):\n\n    if (njs_slow_path(!njs_is_object(value))) {\n        njs_set_undefined(retval);\n        return NJS_DECLINED;\n    }\n\n    object = njs_object(value);\n\n- This ensures subsequent dereference of object is only done for valid object values.\n\nVerification:\n- Ran the project build (secb build) \u2014 build completed successfully.\n- Ran the reproducer (secb repro). Prior to the fix, the reproducer produced AddressSanitizer SEGV at njs_lvlhsh_find. After the change, running the same build+repro no longer triggers the sanitizer SEGV observed previously. (The build and repro commands were executed in the repository; the code change is minimal and focused.)\n\nNotes and recommendations:\n- The change is intentionally minimal and defensive. It avoids dereferencing non-object values in njs_object_property() and therefore prevents the crash path observed.\n- A broader audit of callers could strengthen correctness, and adding unit tests around njs_object_property() with non-object inputs would help prevent regressions.\n\nPatch summary (one-line):\n- src/njs/src/njs_object_prop.c: add njs_is_object check in njs_object_property() before using njs_object(value).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show the exact diff/patch file used.\n- Re-run the build/repro commands and attach their complete outputs.\n\nStatus: I implemented the minimal defensive fix described above.

The macro njs_object(value) (in njs_value.h) directly accesses value->data.u.object without checking that value is actually an object (njs_is_object). If njs_object_property() is called with a non-object value, njs_object(value) will dereference fields leading to undefined behavior and the observed crash inside lvlhsh when accessing an invalid object hash pointer.\n\nAnalysis and proposed fixes:\n- Root cause: njs_object_property() assumes its 'value' argument is an object and immediately converts it via the njs_object() macro. If a non-object value gets passed (for example from an error formatting path), that macro dereferences invalid memory, eventually leading to a segfault inside njs_lvlhsh_find.\n\nPossible approaches:\n1) Add a defensive check at the beginning of njs_object_property() to ensure that 'value' is an object (use njs_is_object) and return NJS_DECLINED if not.\n   - Pros: Minimal change, local fix, no ABI changes, prevents dereferencing non-object values.\n   - Cons: Doesn't fix callers passing invalid values, but safely handles them.\n2) Audit all callers and ensure they pass only object values (fix every caller). \n   - Pros: Strict correctness.\n   - Cons: Broad change across many files, more invasive and error-prone in this task scope.\n3) Change the macro njs_object() to be safer (e.g., an inline function validating type).\n   - Pros: Centralized fix.\n   - Cons: Macro used pervasively, changing it may have broad impact and performance implications.\n\nChosen approach:\n- Implement approach (1): add a defensive check at the top of njs_object_property() to validate the argument is an object (using njs_is_object). If not, set retval to undefined and return NJS_DECLINED. This is the smallest, safest change addressing the crash while minimizing scope.\n\nImplementation (minimal change):\n- File changed: src/njs/src/njs_object_prop.c\n- Change made: Inserted check before dereferencing value via njs_object(value):\n\n    if (njs_slow_path(!njs_is_object(value))) {\n        njs_set_undefined(retval);\n        return NJS_DECLINED;\n    }\n\n    object = njs_object(value);\n\n- This ensures subsequent dereference of object is only done for valid object values.\n\nVerification:\n- Ran the project build (secb build) \u2014 build completed successfully.\n- Ran the reproducer (secb repro). Prior to the fix, the reproducer produced AddressSanitizer SEGV at njs_lvlhsh_find. After the change, running the same build+repro no longer triggers the sanitizer SEGV observed previously. (The build and repro commands were executed in the repository; the code change is minimal and focused.)\n\nNotes and recommendations:\n- The change is intentionally minimal and defensive. It avoids dereferencing non-object values in njs_object_property() and therefore prevents the crash path observed.\n- A broader audit of callers could strengthen correctness, and adding unit tests around njs_object_property() with non-object inputs would help prevent regressions.\n\nPatch summary (one-line):\n- src/njs/src/njs_object_prop.c: add njs_is_object check in njs_object_property() before using njs_object(value).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show the exact diff/patch file used.\n- Re-run the build/repro commands and attach their complete outputs.\n\nStatus: I implemented the minimal defensive fix described above.
