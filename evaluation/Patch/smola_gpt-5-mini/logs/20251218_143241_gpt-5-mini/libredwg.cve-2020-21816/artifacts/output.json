{"output": "Summary of changes and verification\n\n1) Exploration\n- Located vulnerable functions in /src/libredwg/programs/escape.c (htmlescape and htmlwescape), referenced by programs/dwg2SVG.c.\n- The original code used while (*s++) and switch(*s) plus strcat() on a dynamically allocated buffer without properly initializing the destination buffer or ensuring a terminator after realloc, causing heap-buffer-overflow and invalid reads/writes.\n\n2) Analysis (root cause and options)\n- Root cause: uninitialized/incorrect handling of the destination buffer and incorrect pointer use around *s++ / switch(*s), combined with use of strcat which expects a NUL-terminated destination. On realloc the code didn\u2019t preserve or reset the terminator, so strcat could read/write past the allocated region and produce heap-buffer-overflow.\n- Possible fixes:\n  a) Keep strcat but ensure dest is always NUL-terminated, correctly compute lengths before strcat and always maintain space for terminator.\n  b) Replace strcat with direct memcpy/explicit writes, initialize dest[0]='\\0', iterate char-by-char using a local variable (so pointer arithmetic is explicit), and check realloc return values.\n  c) Use a safer string-building approach (e.g. asprintf, dynamic string API).\n- Chosen approach: option (b) \u2014 minimal and focused: initialize dest, iterate carefully using a local char, replace strcat with memcpy/sprintf, safely handle realloc/malloc failures and ensure the string is always NUL-terminated. Also applied the same safe pattern to htmlwescape (wide variant) for parity.\n\n3) Implementation (what changed)\n- Edited: programs/escape.c\n  - Initialized allocated buffers with dest[0] = '\\0'.\n  - Rewrote loops to use while (*s) and read characters into an unsigned char ch variable (instead of using *s++ in condition and then switch(*s)).\n  - Replaced strcat() calls with memcpy() for fixed strings and sprintf for numeric encodings, updating the write pointer accordingly.\n  - On realloc, used a temporary pointer and checked return; if realloc failed we free and return NULL. After successful realloc we restore the write pointer and ensure the destination remains NUL-terminated.\n  - Added malloc/realloc null checks to avoid crashes on OOM.\n- The changes are minimal and localized to escape.c; no other files were modified.\n\n4) Verification\n- Built the project: cd /src/libredwg && secb build \u2014 build completed successfully.\n- Reproduced test case: cd /src/libredwg && secb repro \u2014 reproduction run produced the SVG output and did not trigger AddressSanitizer heap-buffer-overflow (the sanitizer crash from the issue description is no longer observed).\n\n5) Final notes\n- The fix addresses the exact causes that produced the sanitizer output (uninitialized destination, use of strcat with an unterminated buffer, and incorrect pointer usage). The changes are defensive (check malloc/realloc) and keep behavior identical for valid inputs.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Provide a unified patch/diff to review the exact edits.\n- Run additional tests or audit other similar utility functions for the same pattern.\n\nFiles changed:\n- programs/escape.c\n\nStatus: Vulnerability fixed (secb repro completes without sanitizer errors).", "steps": [{"task": "<uploaded_files>\n/src/libredwg\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/libredwg`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/libredwg\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/libredwg`.

assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/libredwg\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/libredwg`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_Z9cgLLIKIHo6CCBbj2Y5VN37', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 18 04:38 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 Jun  6  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 Jun  6  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 Jun  6  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 Jun  6  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 Jun  6  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 Jun  6  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 Jun  6  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 Jun  6  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 Jun  6  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 Jun  6  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 Jun  6  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 Jun  6  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 Jun  6  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 Jun  6  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 Jun  6  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 Jun  6  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 Jun  6  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 Jun  6  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 Jun  6  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 Jun  6  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 Jun  6  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 Jun  6  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 Jun  6  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 Jun  6  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 Jun  6  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 Jun  6  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 Jun  6  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 Jun  6  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 Jun  6  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 Jun  6  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 18 04:38 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 Jun  6  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 Jun  6  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 Jun  6  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 Jun  6  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_Y8O0pQHOg9nptEJS4kBQj6uJ', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"htmlescape\" -n /src/libredwg || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/src/libredwg/programs/escape.h:24:char * ATTRIBUTE_MALLOC htmlescape (const char *restrict src, const int codepage);\n/src/libredwg/programs/escape.c:27:htmlescape (const char *restrict src, const int cp)\n/src/libredwg/programs/dwg2SVG.c:135:    escaped = htmlescape (text->text_value, (int)dwg->header.codepage);\n/src/libredwg/programs/dwg2SVG.c:400:        escaped = htmlescape (hdr->name, dwg->header.codepage);\n/src/libredwg/ChangeLog:1302:\tfixup htmlescape in src/out_json.h\n/src/libredwg/ChangeLog:1314:\tdwg2SVG: htmlescape strings and names"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_MEH5hvIv4YEQtPjHDoS2yP7J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/libredwg/programs/escape.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG -

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/libredwg\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/libredwg`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_Z9cgLLIKIHo6CCBbj2Y5VN37', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 18 04:38 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 Jun  6  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 Jun  6  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 Jun  6  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 Jun  6  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 Jun  6  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 Jun  6  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 Jun  6  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 Jun  6  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 Jun  6  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 Jun  6  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 Jun  6  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 Jun  6  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 Jun  6  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 Jun  6  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 Jun  6  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 Jun  6  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 Jun  6  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 Jun  6  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 Jun  6  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 Jun  6  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 Jun  6  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 Jun  6  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 Jun  6  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 Jun  6  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 Jun  6  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 Jun  6  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 Jun  6  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 Jun  6  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 Jun  6  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 Jun  6  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 18 04:38 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 Jun  6  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 Jun  6  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 Jun  6  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 Jun  6  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_Y8O0pQHOg9nptEJS4kBQj6uJ', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"htmlescape\" -n /src/libredwg || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/src/libredwg/programs/escape.h:24:char * ATTRIBUTE_MALLOC htmlescape (const char *restrict src, const int codepage);\n/src/libredwg/programs/escape.c:27:htmlescape (const char *restrict src, const int cp)\n/src/libredwg/programs/dwg2SVG.c:135:    escaped = htmlescape (text->text_value, (int)dwg->header.codepage);\n/src/libredwg/programs/dwg2SVG.c:400:        escaped = htmlescape (hdr->name, dwg->header.codepage);\n/src/libredwg/ChangeLog:1302:\tfixup htmlescape in src/out_json.h\n/src/libredwg/ChangeLog:1314:\tdwg2SVG: htmlescape strings and names"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_MEH5hvIv4YEQtPjHDoS2yP7J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/libredwg/programs/escape.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG -

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_Z9cgLLIKIHo6CCBbj2Y5VN37', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 18 04:38 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 Jun  6  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 Jun  6  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 Jun  6  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 Jun  6  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 Jun  6  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 Jun  6  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 Jun  6  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 Jun  6  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 Jun  6  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 Jun  6  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 Jun  6  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 Jun  6  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 Jun  6  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 Jun  6  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 Jun  6  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 Jun  6  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 Jun  6  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 Jun  6  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 Jun  6  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 Jun  6  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 Jun  6  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 Jun  6  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 Jun  6  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 Jun  6  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 Jun  6  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 Jun  6  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 Jun  6  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 Jun  6  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 Jun  6  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 Jun  6  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 18 04:38 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 Jun  6  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 Jun  6  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 Jun  6  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 Jun  6  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_Y8O0pQHOg9nptEJS4kBQj6uJ', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"htmlescape\" -n /src/libredwg || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/src/libredwg/programs/escape.h:24:char * ATTRIBUTE_MALLOC htmlescape (const char *restrict src, const int codepage);\n/src/libredwg/programs/escape.c:27:htmlescape (const char *restrict src, const int cp)\n/src/libredwg/programs/dwg2SVG.c:135:    escaped = htmlescape (text->text_value, (int)dwg->header.codepage);\n/src/libredwg/programs/dwg2SVG.c:400:        escaped = htmlescape (hdr->name, dwg->header.codepage);\n/src/libredwg/ChangeLog:1302:\tfixup htmlescape in src/out_json.h\n/src/libredwg/ChangeLog:1314:\tdwg2SVG: htmlescape strings and names"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_MEH5hvIv4YEQtPjHDoS2yP7J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/libredwg/programs/escape.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG -

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_Z9cgLLIKIHo6CCBbj2Y5VN37', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 18 04:38 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 Jun  6  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 Jun  6  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 Jun  6  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 Jun  6  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 Jun  6  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 Jun  6  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 Jun  6  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 Jun  6  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 Jun  6  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 Jun  6  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 Jun  6  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 Jun  6  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 Jun  6  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 Jun  6  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 Jun  6  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 Jun  6  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 Jun  6  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 Jun  6  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 Jun  6  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 Jun  6  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 Jun  6  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 Jun  6  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 Jun  6  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 Jun  6  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 Jun  6  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 Jun  6  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 Jun  6  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 Jun  6  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 Jun  6  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 Jun  6  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 18 04:38 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 Jun  6  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 Jun  6  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 Jun  6  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 Jun  6  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_Y8O0pQHOg9nptEJS4kBQj6uJ', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"htmlescape\" -n /src/libredwg || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/src/libredwg/programs/escape.h:24:char * ATTRIBUTE_MALLOC htmlescape (const char *restrict src, const int codepage);\n/src/libredwg/programs/escape.c:27:htmlescape (const char *restrict src, const int cp)\n/src/libredwg/programs/dwg2SVG.c:135:    escaped = htmlescape (text->text_value, (int)dwg->header.codepage);\n/src/libredwg/programs/dwg2SVG.c:400:        escaped = htmlescape (hdr->name, dwg->header.codepage);\n/src/libredwg/ChangeLog:1302:\tfixup htmlescape in src/out_json.h\n/src/libredwg/ChangeLog:1314:\tdwg2SVG: htmlescape strings and names"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_MEH5hvIv4YEQtPjHDoS2yP7J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/libredwg/programs/escape.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG -

using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_Z9cgLLIKIHo6CCBbj2Y5VN37', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 18 04:38 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 Jun  6  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 Jun  6  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 Jun  6  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 Jun  6  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 Jun  6  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 Jun  6  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 Jun  6  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 Jun  6  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 Jun  6  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 Jun  6  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 Jun  6  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 Jun  6  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 Jun  6  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 Jun  6  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 Jun  6  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 Jun  6  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 Jun  6  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 Jun  6  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 Jun  6  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 Jun  6  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 Jun  6  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 Jun  6  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 Jun  6  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 Jun  6  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 Jun  6  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 Jun  6  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 Jun  6  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 Jun  6  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 Jun  6  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 Jun  6  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 18 04:38 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 Jun  6  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 Jun  6  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 Jun  6  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 Jun  6  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 Jun  6  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_Y8O0pQHOg9nptEJS4kBQj6uJ', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"htmlescape\" -n /src/libredwg || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/src/libredwg/programs/escape.h:24:char * ATTRIBUTE_MALLOC htmlescape (const char *restrict src, const int codepage);\n/src/libredwg/programs/escape.c:27:htmlescape (const char *restrict src, const int cp)\n/src/libredwg/programs/dwg2SVG.c:135:    escaped = htmlescape (text->text_value, (int)dwg->header.codepage);\n/src/libredwg/programs/dwg2SVG.c:400:        escaped = htmlescape (hdr->name, dwg->header.codepage);\n/src/libredwg/ChangeLog:1302:\tfixup htmlescape in src/out_json.h\n/src/libredwg/ChangeLog:1314:\tdwg2SVG: htmlescape strings and names"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_MEH5hvIv4YEQtPjHDoS2yP7J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/libredwg/programs/escape.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG -
