{"output": "Summary\n\nI investigated the heap-buffer-overflow reported in mrb_funcall_with_block (src/vm.c) and implemented a minimal fix. After the change I rebuilt the project and ran the repro harness. The AddressSanitizer heap-buffer-overflow no longer appears (secb build completes and secb repro runs without sanitizer failures). The repro still exercises the code and raises the expected runtime \"boom\" exception from the test case, but there is no heap corruption.\n\nFiles changed (minimal):\n- src/vm.c\n\nWhat I found (exploration)\n\n- The crash stack points to mrb_funcall_with_block in src/vm.c where stack slots for a call are prepared.\n- The VM uses a dynamic stack (c->stbase .. c->stend). The code computes the number of register slots needed for the current call frame via mrb_ci_nregs(ci) and stores that in local variable n. Later it calls mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3); without considering n (register count). The code then copies arguments and sets block slots relative to ci->stack and can write up to n+1 or more slots.\n- The root cause is that the stack extension amount used when preparing the call only accounted for argc-based slots but not the register count (n) required by the call frame. In certain combinations (small argc but larger n), this allowed writes past the end of the allocated stack buffer.\n\nPotential approaches considered\n\n1) Always extend by the maximum of the argc-based need and the register-based need at each call site (minimal change at the call site). Pros: minimal, localized. Cons: none significant.\n\n2) Change cipush() so that ci->stack points inside the stack in a way that avoids writing beyond stend, or make cipush check/extend the stack. Pros: centralizes stack-safety logic. Cons: more invasive change touching callinfo semantics and risk of regressions.\n\n3) Add explicit bounds checks before each write and raise an exception when there is insufficient space. Pros: safe and explicit. Cons: more checks and behavioral changes (would change behavior when running in low-memory situations), more code modifications.\n\nChosen approach\n\nI chose approach (1): at the mrb_funcall_with_block call site, replace the single mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3) with code that computes the required space as the max of (argc + 3) and (n + 2) and then calls mrb_stack_extend(mrb, need).\n\nReasoning: this is a minimal, local change that directly addresses the discovered root cause (insufficient stack extension). It preserves the original behavior where possible, avoids touching core callinfo allocation semantics, and prevents the overflow by ensuring enough space is available for both argument copying and register requirements.\n\nImplementation (what I changed)\n\nIn src/vm.c, inside mrb_funcall_with_block, I replaced:\n\n    mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3);\n\nwith:\n\n    /* Ensure enough stack space for both argc-related and register-related slots. */\n    {\n      mrb_int need = argc + 3;\n      if (n + 2 > need) need = n + 2;\n      mrb_stack_extend(mrb, need);\n    }\n\nThis ensures the requested extension covers both the argc-derived slots and the required register slots (derived from n).\n\nWhy this fixes the issue\n\nThe sanitizer trace shows 8 bytes written just past an allocated 1024-byte region; the stack writes in mrb_funcall_with_block can write block and argument values at offsets based on registers (n) and argc. If only argc-based extension was performed and n was larger, writes ran beyond stend. Extending by the max of both prevents this overflow.\n\nVerification\n\nI performed the following steps inside the repository:\n- Built the project: secb build (BUILD COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY)\n- Ran the repro harness: secb repro\n  - The repro produced the expected exception trace from the test case (RuntimeError: boom) but did not trigger any AddressSanitizer heap-buffer-overflow. The sanitizer abort that was originally present is gone.\n\nNotes and alternatives\n\n- A more centralized fix (e.g., ensuring cipush always verifies/ensures required stack space when it sets ci->stack) would also be reasonable and perhaps more robust long-term. However it requires more invasive changes. The applied change is minimal and should be safe.\n\n- I did not modify tests or non-src files. The change is small and local to src/vm.c.\n\nPatch (git diff)\n\nThe produced diff (applied) is:\n\n--- a/src/vm.c\n+++ b/src/vm.c\n@@ -478,7 +478,12 @@ mrb_funcall_with_block(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self, mrb_sym mid, mrb_int argc\n     }\n     c = mrb_class(mrb, self);\n     m = mrb_method_search_vm(mrb, &c, mid);\n-    mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3);\n+    /* Ensure enough stack space for both argc-related and register-related slots. */\n+    {\n+      mrb_int need = argc + 3;\n+      if (n + 2 > need) need = n + 2;\n+      mrb_stack_extend(mrb, need);\n+    }\n     if (MRB_METHOD_UNDEF_P(m) || argc >= 15) {\n       mrb_value args = mrb_ary_new_from_values(mrb, argc, argv);\n\n\nIf you'd like, I can:\n- Rework the fix into a slightly more centralized change (e.g., ensure cipush validates/extends the stack as needed) if you prefer that design.\n- Add an explanatory comment or a small unit test exercising the previously failing pattern.\n\nIf you want to review the exact commit, I can produce the commit/patch file or add further documentation.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}], "tool_calls": [{"id":

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

After the change I rebuilt the project and ran the repro harness. The AddressSanitizer heap-buffer-overflow no longer appears (secb build completes and secb repro runs without sanitizer failures). The repro still exercises the code and raises the expected runtime \"boom\" exception from the test case, but there is no heap corruption.\n\nFiles changed (minimal):\n- src/vm.c\n\nWhat I found (exploration)\n\n- The crash stack points to mrb_funcall_with_block in src/vm.c where stack slots for a call are prepared.\n- The VM uses a dynamic stack (c->stbase .. c->stend). The code computes the number of register slots needed for the current call frame via mrb_ci_nregs(ci) and stores that in local variable n. Later it calls mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3); without considering n (register count). The code then copies arguments and sets block slots relative to ci->stack and can write up to n+1 or more slots.\n- The root cause is that the stack extension amount used when preparing the call only accounted for argc-based slots but not the register count (n) required by the call frame. In certain combinations (small argc but larger n), this allowed writes past the end of the allocated stack buffer.\n\nPotential approaches considered\n\n1) Always extend by the maximum of the argc-based need and the register-based need at each call site (minimal change at the call site). Pros: minimal, localized. Cons: none significant.\n\n2) Change cipush() so that ci->stack points inside the stack in a way that avoids writing beyond stend, or make cipush check/extend the stack. Pros: centralizes stack-safety logic. Cons: more invasive change touching callinfo semantics and risk of regressions.\n\n3) Add explicit bounds checks before each write and raise an exception when there is insufficient space. Pros: safe and explicit. Cons: more checks and behavioral changes (would change behavior when running in low-memory situations), more code modifications.\n\nChosen approach\n\nI chose approach (1): at the mrb_funcall_with_block call site, replace the single mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3) with code that computes the required space as the max of (argc + 3) and (n + 2) and then calls mrb_stack_extend(mrb, need).\n\nReasoning: this is a minimal, local change that directly addresses the discovered root cause (insufficient stack extension). It preserves the original behavior where possible, avoids touching core callinfo allocation semantics, and prevents the overflow by ensuring enough space is available for both argument copying and register requirements.\n\nImplementation (what I changed)\n\nIn src/vm.c, inside mrb_funcall_with_block, I replaced:\n\n    mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3);\n\nwith:\n\n    /* Ensure enough stack space for both argc-related and register-related slots. */\n    {\n      mrb_int need = argc + 3;\n      if (n + 2 > need) need = n + 2;\n      mrb_stack_extend(mrb, need);\n    }\n\nThis ensures the requested extension covers both the argc-derived slots and the required register slots (derived from n).\n\nWhy this fixes the issue\n\nThe sanitizer trace shows 8 bytes written just past an allocated 1024-byte region; the stack writes in mrb_funcall_with_block can write block and argument values at offsets based on registers (n) and argc. If only argc-based extension was performed and n was larger, writes ran beyond stend. Extending by the max of both prevents this overflow.\n\nVerification\n\nI performed the following steps inside the repository:\n- Built the project: secb build (BUILD COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY)\n- Ran the repro harness: secb repro\n  - The repro produced the expected exception trace from the test case (RuntimeError: boom) but did not trigger any AddressSanitizer heap-buffer-overflow.

After the change I rebuilt the project and ran the repro harness. The AddressSanitizer heap-buffer-overflow no longer appears (secb build completes and secb repro runs without sanitizer failures). The repro still exercises the code and raises the expected runtime \"boom\" exception from the test case, but there is no heap corruption.\n\nFiles changed (minimal):\n- src/vm.c\n\nWhat I found (exploration)\n\n- The crash stack points to mrb_funcall_with_block in src/vm.c where stack slots for a call are prepared.\n- The VM uses a dynamic stack (c->stbase .. c->stend). The code computes the number of register slots needed for the current call frame via mrb_ci_nregs(ci) and stores that in local variable n. Later it calls mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3); without considering n (register count). The code then copies arguments and sets block slots relative to ci->stack and can write up to n+1 or more slots.\n- The root cause is that the stack extension amount used when preparing the call only accounted for argc-based slots but not the register count (n) required by the call frame. In certain combinations (small argc but larger n), this allowed writes past the end of the allocated stack buffer.\n\nPotential approaches considered\n\n1) Always extend by the maximum of the argc-based need and the register-based need at each call site (minimal change at the call site). Pros: minimal, localized. Cons: none significant.\n\n2) Change cipush() so that ci->stack points inside the stack in a way that avoids writing beyond stend, or make cipush check/extend the stack. Pros: centralizes stack-safety logic. Cons: more invasive change touching callinfo semantics and risk of regressions.\n\n3) Add explicit bounds checks before each write and raise an exception when there is insufficient space. Pros: safe and explicit. Cons: more checks and behavioral changes (would change behavior when running in low-memory situations), more code modifications.\n\nChosen approach\n\nI chose approach (1): at the mrb_funcall_with_block call site, replace the single mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3) with code that computes the required space as the max of (argc + 3) and (n + 2) and then calls mrb_stack_extend(mrb, need).\n\nReasoning: this is a minimal, local change that directly addresses the discovered root cause (insufficient stack extension). It preserves the original behavior where possible, avoids touching core callinfo allocation semantics, and prevents the overflow by ensuring enough space is available for both argument copying and register requirements.\n\nImplementation (what I changed)\n\nIn src/vm.c, inside mrb_funcall_with_block, I replaced:\n\n    mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3);\n\nwith:\n\n    /* Ensure enough stack space for both argc-related and register-related slots. */\n    {\n      mrb_int need = argc + 3;\n      if (n + 2 > need) need = n + 2;\n      mrb_stack_extend(mrb, need);\n    }\n\nThis ensures the requested extension covers both the argc-derived slots and the required register slots (derived from n).\n\nWhy this fixes the issue\n\nThe sanitizer trace shows 8 bytes written just past an allocated 1024-byte region; the stack writes in mrb_funcall_with_block can write block and argument values at offsets based on registers (n) and argc. If only argc-based extension was performed and n was larger, writes ran beyond stend. Extending by the max of both prevents this overflow.\n\nVerification\n\nI performed the following steps inside the repository:\n- Built the project: secb build (BUILD COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY)\n- Ran the repro harness: secb repro\n  - The repro produced the expected exception trace from the test case (RuntimeError: boom) but did not trigger any AddressSanitizer heap-buffer-overflow. The sanitizer abort that was originally present is gone.\n\nNotes and alternatives\n\n- A more centralized fix (e.g., ensuring cipush always verifies/ensures required stack space when it sets ci->stack) would also be reasonable and perhaps more robust long-term. However it requires more invasive changes. The applied change is minimal and should be safe.\n\n- I did not modify tests or non-src files.
