{"output": "Summary of changes and verification\n\nWhat I found\n- The AddressSanitizer trace showed a heap-buffer-overflow in MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h:GetPixelAlpha called from coders/xpm.c:WritePICONImage.\n- In WritePICONImage the variable q is a pointer obtained from GetAuthenticPixels(picon,...). The code was incorrectly calling GetPixelAlpha(image, q) (i.e. passing the original input image) rather than GetPixelAlpha(picon, q). Because q points into picon's pixel cache, indexing with image->channel_map could read past the allocated buffer and trigger ASan.\n\nSelected fix (minimal, targeted)\n- Replace uses of GetPixelAlpha(image, q) inside WritePICONImage with GetPixelAlpha(picon, q). This is the minimal change that keeps the intended logic (checking the alpha of the picon pixels) while eliminating out-of-bounds reads.\n\nFiles changed\n- coders/xpm.c\n  - Two occurrences in WritePICONImage replaced:\n    - if (GetPixelAlpha(image,q) == (Quantum) TransparentAlpha) -> if (GetPixelAlpha(picon,q) == (Quantum) TransparentAlpha)\n    - if (GetPixelAlpha(image,q) == (Quantum) TransparentAlpha) -> if (GetPixelAlpha(picon,q) == (Quantum) TransparentAlpha)\n  (These were the checks iterating over picon rows where q was obtained from picon.)\n\nPatch (already applied during the session)\n- A small git-style diff was produced (shown during the run). The change is localized and minimal.\n\nBuild and repro\n- I ran the repository build (secb build) in /src/imagemagick. Build completed successfully.\n- I ran secb repro. The repro output contained TIFF warnings/errors but did NOT produce an AddressSanitizer heap-buffer-overflow or abort. This indicates the crash described in the issue (GetPixelAlpha heap-buffer-overread from WritePICONImage) is no longer triggered by the supplied repro case.\n\nWhy this fixes the vulnerability\n- The root cause was using the wrong Image pointer when reading alpha from pixels (reading pixel components using the channel_map of the wrong image). By switching to the image (picon) that owns the pixels pointed to by q, the pixel accessor uses correct offsets and channel traits, preventing out-of-bounds indexing.\n\nNotes and trade-offs\n- This is a minimal, context-correct fix: it does not change pixel semantics except to read alpha from the correct image. No performance or API changes.\n- Alternative broader fixes could add defensive bounds checks in GetPixelAlpha or validate that the pointer passed to GetPixelAlpha belongs to the same image, but those would be larger and riskier changes across the codebase. The targeted change is safer and fully addresses the specific crash.\n\nWhat I ran (high-level)\n- Copied a backup of coders/xpm.c and replaced the two incorrect calls with GetPixelAlpha(picon,q).\n- cd /src/imagemagick && secb build  -> BUILD COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY\n- cd /src/imagemagick && secb repro  -> produced TIFF warnings/errors but no ASan crash\n\nIf you want\n- I can open a follow-up patch that checks other similar call sites for mismatched image/pixel pointer usage (grep for places where GetAuthenticPixels is called and then GetPixelAlpha is invoked with a different image), but the reproducer crash is addressed by the minimal change above.\n\nConclusion\n- The minimal change in coders/xpm.c ensures GetPixelAlpha is called with picon (the image that owns q) instead of image. The project builds and the supplied repro no longer triggers the AddressSanitizer heap-buffer-overflow, so the critical success criterion is satisfied.", "steps": [{"task": "<uploaded_files>\n/src/imagemagick\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/imagemagick`.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/imagemagick` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_FEHCxvkbql6yV37vEtslTEMP', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/imagemagick || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 2988\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:19 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     147 May 31  2025 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1746 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    5805 May 31  2025 AUTHORS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  126995 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   10738 May 31  2025 ImageMagick.spec.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2966 May 31  2025 Install-mac.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   28259 May 31  2025 Install-unix.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1144 May 31  2025 Install-vms.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     122 May 31  2025 Install-windows.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12478 May 31  2025 LICENSE\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 Magick++\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 MagickCore\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 MagickWand\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    8627 May 31  2025 Magickshr.opt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7685 May 31  2025 Make.com\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   11377 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1259411 May 31  2025 Makefile.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2057 May 31  2025 NEWS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12016 May 31  2025 NOTICE\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root    4096 May 31  2025 PerlMagick\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    4497 May 31  2025 QuickStart.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    9845 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7386 May 31  2025 README.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     891 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   47329 May 31  2025 aclocal.m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 api_examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 app-image\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 coders\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1278 May 31  2025 common.shi.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 config\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1178579 May 31  2025 configure\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  133969 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 filters\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 images\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   17677 May 31  2025 index.html\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 m4\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    1567 May 31  2025 magick.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 scripts\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:20 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 utilities\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1789 May 31  2025 winpath.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 www"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}], "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_GVEHb64YvuJoknIaMIpslqBF", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "cmd", "arguments": {"command": "sed -n '1,240p' /src/imagemagick/MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h"}}}], "error": null, "model_output_message": {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"_type": "ChatCompletionMessageToolCall"}], "raw": {"_type": "ModelResponse", "id": "chatcmpl-CoP5B741sRSuW3W2ED6i3i9dlQVpn", "created": 1766128853, "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"_type": "Choices", "finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"_type": "Message", "content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"_type": "ChatCompletionMessageToolCall"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "_response_ms": 9009.09}, "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 4715, "output_tokens": 109, "total_tokens": 4824, "cost": 0.000365375}}, "model_output": null, "code_action": null, "observations": "/*\n  Copyright 1999-2021 ImageMagick Studio LLC, a non-profit organization\n  dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.\n\n  You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

This issue can potentially lead to a denial of service and information disclosure.\n---\n==46632==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x62a00000b540 at pc 0x7f7e88ca3257 bp 0x7fffdb9f7370 sp 0x7fffdb9f7360\nREAD of size 4 at 0x62a00000b540 thread T0\n    #0 0x7f7e88ca3256 in GetPixelAlpha MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h:59\n    #1 0x7f7e88ca763e in WritePICONImage coders/xpm.c:807\n    #2 0x7f7e885f73ef in WriteImage MagickCore/constitute.c:1221\n    #3 0x7f7e885f84a0 in WriteImages MagickCore/constitute.c:1442\n    #4 0x7f7e87e5239f in ConvertImageCommand MagickWand/convert.c:3332\n    #5 0x7f7e87f604cf in MagickCommandGenesis MagickWand/mogrify.c:188\n    #6 0x55a7a3ebefcf in MagickMain utilities/magick.c:150\n    #7 0x55a7a3ebf25a in main utilities/magick.c:182\n    #8 0x7f7e876c2bf6 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21bf6)\n    #9 0x55a7a3ebe9e9 in _start (/home/r0fm1a/ImageMagick/utilities/.libs/magick+0x19e9)\n\n0x62a00000b540 is located 0 bytes to the right of 21312-byte region [0x62a000006200,0x62a00000b540)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x7f7e893e3790 in posix_memalign (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.4+0xdf790)\n    #1 0x7f7e887d1c99 in AcquireAlignedMemory_POSIX MagickCore/memory.c:299\n    #2 0x7f7e887d1ea8 in AcquireAlignedMemory MagickCore/memory.c:377\n    #3 0x7f7e88582e0e in OpenPixelCache MagickCore/cache.c:3746\n    #4 0x7f7e8857b296 in GetImagePixelCache MagickCore/cache.c:1776\n    #5 0x7f7e8858b2de in SyncImagePixelCache MagickCore/cache.c:5516\n    #6 0x7f7e88798568 in SetImageStorageClass MagickCore/image.c:2626\n    #7 0x7f7e885ab718 in AcquireImageColormap MagickCore/colormap.c:152\n    #8 0x7f7e888731cd in SetGrayscaleImage MagickCore/quantize.c:3772\n    #9 0x7f7e888714e7 in QuantizeImage MagickCore/quantize.c:3118\n    #10 0x7f7e88866f5d in CompressImageColormap MagickCore/quantize.c:1204\n    #11 0x7f7e88ca6f6a in WritePICONImage coders/xpm.c:755\n    #12 0x7f7e885f73ef in WriteImage MagickCore/constitute.c:1221\n    #13 0x7f7e885f84a0 in WriteImages MagickCore/constitute.c:1442\n    #14 0x7f7e87e5239f in ConvertImageCommand MagickWand/convert.c:3332\n    #15 0x7f7e87f604cf in MagickCommandGenesis MagickWand/mogrify.c:188\n    #16 0x55a7a3ebefcf in MagickMain utilities/magick.c:150\n    #17 0x55a7a3ebf25a in main utilities/magick.c:182\n    #18 0x7f7e876c2bf6 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21bf6)\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h:59 in GetPixelAlpha\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x0c547fff9650: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x0c547fff9660: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x0c547fff9670: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x0c547fff9680: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x0c547fff9690: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n=>0x0c547fff96a0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96b0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96c0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96d0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96e0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96f0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n==46632==ABORTING\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/imagemagick` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/imagemagick` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_FEHCxvkbql6yV37vEtslTEMP', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/imagemagick || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 2988\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:19 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     147 May 31  2025 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1746 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    5805 May 31  2025 AUTHORS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  126995 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   10738 May 31  2025 ImageMagick.spec.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2966 May 31  2025 Install-mac.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   28259 May 31  2025 Install-unix.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1144 May 31  2025 Install-vms.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     122 May 31  2025 Install-windows.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12478 May 31  2025 LICENSE\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 Magick++\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 MagickCore\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 MagickWand\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    8627 May 31  2025 Magickshr.opt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7685 May 31  2025 Make.com\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   11377 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1259411 May 31  2025 Makefile.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2057 May 31  2025 NEWS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12016 May 31  2025 NOTICE\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root    4096 May 31  2025 PerlMagick\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    4497 May 31  2025 QuickStart.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    9845 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7386 May 31  2025 README.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     891 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   47329 May 31  2025 aclocal.m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 api_examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 app-image\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 coders\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1278 May 31  2025 common.shi.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 config\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1178579 May 31  2025 configure\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  133969 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 filters\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 images\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   17677 May 31  2025 index.html\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 m4\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    1567 May 31  2025 magick.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 scripts\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:20 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 utilities\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1789 May 31  2025 winpath.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 www"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_GVEHb64YvuJoknIaMIpslqBF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/imagemagick/MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n  Copyright 1999-2021 ImageMagick Studio LLC, a non-profit organization\n  dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.\n\n  You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

This issue can potentially lead to a denial of service and information disclosure.\n---\n==46632==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x62a00000b540 at pc 0x7f7e88ca3257 bp 0x7fffdb9f7370 sp 0x7fffdb9f7360\nREAD of size 4 at 0x62a00000b540 thread T0\n    #0 0x7f7e88ca3256 in GetPixelAlpha MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h:59\n    #1 0x7f7e88ca763e in WritePICONImage coders/xpm.c:807\n    #2 0x7f7e885f73ef in WriteImage MagickCore/constitute.c:1221\n    #3 0x7f7e885f84a0 in WriteImages MagickCore/constitute.c:1442\n    #4 0x7f7e87e5239f in ConvertImageCommand MagickWand/convert.c:3332\n    #5 0x7f7e87f604cf in MagickCommandGenesis MagickWand/mogrify.c:188\n    #6 0x55a7a3ebefcf in MagickMain utilities/magick.c:150\n    #7 0x55a7a3ebf25a in main utilities/magick.c:182\n    #8 0x7f7e876c2bf6 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21bf6)\n    #9 0x55a7a3ebe9e9 in _start (/home/r0fm1a/ImageMagick/utilities/.libs/magick+0x19e9)\n\n0x62a00000b540 is located 0 bytes to the right of 21312-byte region [0x62a000006200,0x62a00000b540)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x7f7e893e3790 in posix_memalign (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.4+0xdf790)\n    #1 0x7f7e887d1c99 in AcquireAlignedMemory_POSIX MagickCore/memory.c:299\n    #2 0x7f7e887d1ea8 in AcquireAlignedMemory MagickCore/memory.c:377\n    #3 0x7f7e88582e0e in OpenPixelCache MagickCore/cache.c:3746\n    #4 0x7f7e8857b296 in GetImagePixelCache MagickCore/cache.c:1776\n    #5 0x7f7e8858b2de in SyncImagePixelCache MagickCore/cache.c:5516\n    #6 0x7f7e88798568 in SetImageStorageClass MagickCore/image.c:2626\n    #7 0x7f7e885ab718 in AcquireImageColormap MagickCore/colormap.c:152\n    #8 0x7f7e888731cd in SetGrayscaleImage MagickCore/quantize.c:3772\n    #9 0x7f7e888714e7 in QuantizeImage MagickCore/quantize.c:3118\n    #10 0x7f7e88866f5d in CompressImageColormap MagickCore/quantize.c:1204\n    #11 0x7f7e88ca6f6a in WritePICONImage coders/xpm.c:755\n    #12 0x7f7e885f73ef in WriteImage MagickCore/constitute.c:1221\n    #13 0x7f7e885f84a0 in WriteImages MagickCore/constitute.c:1442\n    #14 0x7f7e87e5239f in ConvertImageCommand MagickWand/convert.c:3332\n    #15 0x7f7e87f604cf in MagickCommandGenesis MagickWand/mogrify.c:188\n    #16 0x55a7a3ebefcf in MagickMain utilities/magick.c:150\n    #17 0x55a7a3ebf25a in main utilities/magick.c:182\n    #18 0x7f7e876c2bf6 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21bf6)\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h:59 in GetPixelAlpha\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x0c547fff9650: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x0c547fff9660: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x0c547fff9670: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x0c547fff9680: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x0c547fff9690: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n=>0x0c547fff96a0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96b0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96c0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96d0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96e0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96f0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n==46632==ABORTING\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/imagemagick` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/imagemagick` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_FEHCxvkbql6yV37vEtslTEMP', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/imagemagick || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 2988\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:19 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     147 May 31  2025 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1746 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    5805 May 31  2025 AUTHORS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  126995 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   10738 May 31  2025 ImageMagick.spec.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2966 May 31  2025 Install-mac.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   28259 May 31  2025 Install-unix.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1144 May 31  2025 Install-vms.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     122 May 31  2025 Install-windows.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12478 May 31  2025 LICENSE\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 Magick++\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 MagickCore\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 MagickWand\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    8627 May 31  2025 Magickshr.opt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7685 May 31  2025 Make.com\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   11377 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1259411 May 31  2025 Makefile.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2057 May 31  2025 NEWS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12016 May 31  2025 NOTICE\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root    4096 May 31  2025 PerlMagick\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    4497 May 31  2025 QuickStart.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    9845 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7386 May 31  2025 README.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     891 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   47329 May 31  2025 aclocal.m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 api_examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 app-image\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 coders\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1278 May 31  2025 common.shi.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 config\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1178579 May 31  2025 configure\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  133969 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 filters\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 images\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   17677 May 31  2025 index.html\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 m4\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    1567 May 31  2025 magick.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 scripts\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:20 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 utilities\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1789 May 31  2025 winpath.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 www"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_GVEHb64YvuJoknIaMIpslqBF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/imagemagick/MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n  Copyright 1999-2021 ImageMagick Studio LLC, a non-profit organization\n  dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.\n\n  You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/imagemagick` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_FEHCxvkbql6yV37vEtslTEMP', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/imagemagick || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 2988\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:19 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     147 May 31  2025 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1746 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    5805 May 31  2025 AUTHORS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  126995 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   10738 May 31  2025 ImageMagick.spec.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2966 May 31  2025 Install-mac.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   28259 May 31  2025 Install-unix.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1144 May 31  2025 Install-vms.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     122 May 31  2025 Install-windows.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12478 May 31  2025 LICENSE\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 Magick++\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 MagickCore\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 MagickWand\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    8627 May 31  2025 Magickshr.opt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7685 May 31  2025 Make.com\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   11377 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1259411 May 31  2025 Makefile.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2057 May 31  2025 NEWS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12016 May 31  2025 NOTICE\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root    4096 May 31  2025 PerlMagick\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    4497 May 31  2025 QuickStart.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    9845 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7386 May 31  2025 README.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     891 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   47329 May 31  2025 aclocal.m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 api_examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 app-image\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 coders\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1278 May 31  2025 common.shi.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 config\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1178579 May 31  2025 configure\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  133969 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 filters\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 images\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   17677 May 31  2025 index.html\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 m4\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    1567 May 31  2025 magick.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 scripts\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:20 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 utilities\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1789 May 31  2025 winpath.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 www"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_GVEHb64YvuJoknIaMIpslqBF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/imagemagick/MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n  Copyright 1999-2021 ImageMagick Studio LLC, a non-profit organization\n  dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.\n\n  You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/imagemagick` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_FEHCxvkbql6yV37vEtslTEMP', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/imagemagick || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 2988\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:19 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     147 May 31  2025 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1746 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    5805 May 31  2025 AUTHORS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  126995 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   10738 May 31  2025 ImageMagick.spec.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2966 May 31  2025 Install-mac.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   28259 May 31  2025 Install-unix.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1144 May 31  2025 Install-vms.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     122 May 31  2025 Install-windows.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12478 May 31  2025 LICENSE\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 Magick++\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 MagickCore\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 MagickWand\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    8627 May 31  2025 Magickshr.opt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7685 May 31  2025 Make.com\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   11377 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1259411 May 31  2025 Makefile.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2057 May 31  2025 NEWS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12016 May 31  2025 NOTICE\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root    4096 May 31  2025 PerlMagick\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    4497 May 31  2025 QuickStart.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    9845 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7386 May 31  2025 README.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     891 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   47329 May 31  2025 aclocal.m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 api_examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 app-image\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 coders\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1278 May 31  2025 common.shi.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 config\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1178579 May 31  2025 configure\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  133969 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 filters\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 images\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   17677 May 31  2025 index.html\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 m4\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    1567 May 31  2025 magick.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 scripts\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:20 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 utilities\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1789 May 31  2025 winpath.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 www"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_GVEHb64YvuJoknIaMIpslqBF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/imagemagick/MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n  Copyright 1999-2021 ImageMagick Studio LLC, a non-profit organization\n  dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.\n\n  You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/imagemagick` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_FEHCxvkbql6yV37vEtslTEMP', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/imagemagick || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 2988\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:19 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     147 May 31  2025 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1746 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    5805 May 31  2025 AUTHORS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  126995 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   10738 May 31  2025 ImageMagick.spec.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2966 May 31  2025 Install-mac.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   28259 May 31  2025 Install-unix.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1144 May 31  2025 Install-vms.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     122 May 31  2025 Install-windows.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12478 May 31  2025 LICENSE\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 Magick++\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 MagickCore\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 MagickWand\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    8627 May 31  2025 Magickshr.opt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7685 May 31  2025 Make.com\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   11377 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1259411 May 31  2025 Makefile.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2057 May 31  2025 NEWS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12016 May 31  2025 NOTICE\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root    4096 May 31  2025 PerlMagick\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    4497 May 31  2025 QuickStart.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    9845 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7386 May 31  2025 README.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     891 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   47329 May 31  2025 aclocal.m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 api_examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 app-image\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 coders\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1278 May 31  2025 common.shi.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 config\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1178579 May 31  2025 configure\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  133969 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 filters\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 images\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   17677 May 31  2025 index.html\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 m4\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    1567 May 31  2025 magick.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 scripts\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:20 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 utilities\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1789 May 31  2025 winpath.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 www"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_GVEHb64YvuJoknIaMIpslqBF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/imagemagick/MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n  Copyright 1999-2021 ImageMagick Studio LLC, a non-profit organization\n  dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.\n\n  You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/imagemagick\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/imagemagick`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/imagemagick` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_FEHCxvkbql6yV37vEtslTEMP', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/imagemagick || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 2988\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:19 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     147 May 31  2025 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1746 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    5805 May 31  2025 AUTHORS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  126995 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   10738 May 31  2025 ImageMagick.spec.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2966 May 31  2025 Install-mac.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   28259 May 31  2025 Install-unix.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1144 May 31  2025 Install-vms.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     122 May 31  2025 Install-windows.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12478 May 31  2025 LICENSE\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 Magick++\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 MagickCore\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 MagickWand\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    8627 May 31  2025 Magickshr.opt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7685 May 31  2025 Make.com\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   11377 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1259411 May 31  2025 Makefile.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2057 May 31  2025 NEWS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12016 May 31  2025 NOTICE\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root    4096 May 31  2025 PerlMagick\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    4497 May 31  2025 QuickStart.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    9845 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7386 May 31  2025 README.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     891 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   47329 May 31  2025 aclocal.m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 api_examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 app-image\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 coders\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1278 May 31  2025 common.shi.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 config\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1178579 May 31  2025 configure\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  133969 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 filters\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 images\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   17677 May 31  2025 index.html\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 m4\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    1567 May 31  2025 magick.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 scripts\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:20 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 utilities\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1789 May 31  2025 winpath.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 www"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_GVEHb64YvuJoknIaMIpslqBF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/imagemagick/MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n  Copyright 1999-2021 ImageMagick Studio LLC, a non-profit organization\n  dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.\n\n  You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/imagemagick` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_FEHCxvkbql6yV37vEtslTEMP', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/imagemagick || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 2988\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:19 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     147 May 31  2025 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1746 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    5805 May 31  2025 AUTHORS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  126995 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   10738 May 31  2025 ImageMagick.spec.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2966 May 31  2025 Install-mac.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   28259 May 31  2025 Install-unix.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1144 May 31  2025 Install-vms.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     122 May 31  2025 Install-windows.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12478 May 31  2025 LICENSE\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 Magick++\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 MagickCore\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 MagickWand\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    8627 May 31  2025 Magickshr.opt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7685 May 31  2025 Make.com\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   11377 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1259411 May 31  2025 Makefile.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2057 May 31  2025 NEWS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12016 May 31  2025 NOTICE\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root    4096 May 31  2025 PerlMagick\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    4497 May 31  2025 QuickStart.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    9845 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7386 May 31  2025 README.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     891 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   47329 May 31  2025 aclocal.m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 api_examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 app-image\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 coders\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1278 May 31  2025 common.shi.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 config\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1178579 May 31  2025 configure\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  133969 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 filters\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 images\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   17677 May 31  2025 index.html\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 m4\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    1567 May 31  2025 magick.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 scripts\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:20 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 utilities\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1789 May 31  2025 winpath.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 www"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_GVEHb64YvuJoknIaMIpslqBF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/imagemagick/MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n  Copyright 1999-2021 ImageMagick Studio LLC, a non-profit organization\n  dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.\n\n  You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/imagemagick\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/imagemagick`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/imagemagick` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_FEHCxvkbql6yV37vEtslTEMP', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/imagemagick || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 2988\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:19 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     147 May 31  2025 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1746 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    5805 May 31  2025 AUTHORS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  126995 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   10738 May 31  2025 ImageMagick.spec.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2966 May 31  2025 Install-mac.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   28259 May 31  2025 Install-unix.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1144 May 31  2025 Install-vms.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     122 May 31  2025 Install-windows.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12478 May 31  2025 LICENSE\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 Magick++\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 MagickCore\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 MagickWand\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    8627 May 31  2025 Magickshr.opt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7685 May 31  2025 Make.com\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   11377 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1259411 May 31  2025 Makefile.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2057 May 31  2025 NEWS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12016 May 31  2025 NOTICE\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root    4096 May 31  2025 PerlMagick\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    4497 May 31  2025 QuickStart.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    9845 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7386 May 31  2025 README.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     891 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   47329 May 31  2025 aclocal.m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 api_examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 app-image\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 coders\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1278 May 31  2025 common.shi.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 config\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1178579 May 31  2025 configure\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  133969 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 filters\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 images\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   17677 May 31  2025 index.html\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 m4\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    1567 May 31  2025 magick.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 scripts\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:20 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 utilities\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1789 May 31  2025 winpath.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 www"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_GVEHb64YvuJoknIaMIpslqBF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/imagemagick/MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n  Copyright 1999-2021 ImageMagick Studio LLC, a non-profit organization\n  dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.\n\n  You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop.

It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

This issue can potentially lead to a denial of service and information disclosure.\n---\n==46632==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x62a00000b540 at pc 0x7f7e88ca3257 bp 0x7fffdb9f7370 sp 0x7fffdb9f7360\nREAD of size 4 at 0x62a00000b540 thread T0\n    #0 0x7f7e88ca3256 in GetPixelAlpha MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h:59\n    #1 0x7f7e88ca763e in WritePICONImage coders/xpm.c:807\n    #2 0x7f7e885f73ef in WriteImage MagickCore/constitute.c:1221\n    #3 0x7f7e885f84a0 in WriteImages MagickCore/constitute.c:1442\n    #4 0x7f7e87e5239f in ConvertImageCommand MagickWand/convert.c:3332\n    #5 0x7f7e87f604cf in MagickCommandGenesis MagickWand/mogrify.c:188\n    #6 0x55a7a3ebefcf in MagickMain utilities/magick.c:150\n    #7 0x55a7a3ebf25a in main utilities/magick.c:182\n    #8 0x7f7e876c2bf6 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21bf6)\n    #9 0x55a7a3ebe9e9 in _start (/home/r0fm1a/ImageMagick/utilities/.libs/magick+0x19e9)\n\n0x62a00000b540 is located 0 bytes to the right of 21312-byte region [0x62a000006200,0x62a00000b540)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x7f7e893e3790 in posix_memalign (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.4+0xdf790)\n    #1 0x7f7e887d1c99 in AcquireAlignedMemory_POSIX MagickCore/memory.c:299\n    #2 0x7f7e887d1ea8 in AcquireAlignedMemory MagickCore/memory.c:377\n    #3 0x7f7e88582e0e in OpenPixelCache MagickCore/cache.c:3746\n    #4 0x7f7e8857b296 in GetImagePixelCache MagickCore/cache.c:1776\n    #5 0x7f7e8858b2de in SyncImagePixelCache MagickCore/cache.c:5516\n    #6 0x7f7e88798568 in SetImageStorageClass MagickCore/image.c:2626\n    #7 0x7f7e885ab718 in AcquireImageColormap MagickCore/colormap.c:152\n    #8 0x7f7e888731cd in SetGrayscaleImage MagickCore/quantize.c:3772\n    #9 0x7f7e888714e7 in QuantizeImage MagickCore/quantize.c:3118\n    #10 0x7f7e88866f5d in CompressImageColormap MagickCore/quantize.c:1204\n    #11 0x7f7e88ca6f6a in WritePICONImage coders/xpm.c:755\n    #12 0x7f7e885f73ef in WriteImage MagickCore/constitute.c:1221\n    #13 0x7f7e885f84a0 in WriteImages MagickCore/constitute.c:1442\n    #14 0x7f7e87e5239f in ConvertImageCommand MagickWand/convert.c:3332\n    #15 0x7f7e87f604cf in MagickCommandGenesis MagickWand/mogrify.c:188\n    #16 0x55a7a3ebefcf in MagickMain utilities/magick.c:150\n    #17 0x55a7a3ebf25a in main utilities/magick.c:182\n    #18 0x7f7e876c2bf6 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21bf6)\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h:59 in GetPixelAlpha\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x0c547fff9650: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x0c547fff9660: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x0c547fff9670: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x0c547fff9680: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x0c547fff9690: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n=>0x0c547fff96a0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96b0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96c0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96d0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96e0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x0c547fff96f0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n==46632==ABORTING\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/imagemagick` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/imagemagick` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_FEHCxvkbql6yV37vEtslTEMP', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/imagemagick || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 2988\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:19 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     147 May 31  2025 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1746 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    5805 May 31  2025 AUTHORS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  126995 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   10738 May 31  2025 ImageMagick.spec.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2966 May 31  2025 Install-mac.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   28259 May 31  2025 Install-unix.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1144 May 31  2025 Install-vms.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     122 May 31  2025 Install-windows.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12478 May 31  2025 LICENSE\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 Magick++\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 MagickCore\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 MagickWand\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    8627 May 31  2025 Magickshr.opt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7685 May 31  2025 Make.com\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   11377 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1259411 May 31  2025 Makefile.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2057 May 31  2025 NEWS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12016 May 31  2025 NOTICE\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root    4096 May 31  2025 PerlMagick\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    4497 May 31  2025 QuickStart.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    9845 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7386 May 31  2025 README.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     891 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   47329 May 31  2025 aclocal.m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 api_examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 app-image\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 coders\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1278 May 31  2025 common.shi.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 config\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1178579 May 31  2025 configure\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  133969 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 filters\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 images\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   17677 May 31  2025 index.html\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 m4\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    1567 May 31  2025 magick.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 scripts\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:20 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 utilities\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1789 May 31  2025 winpath.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 www"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_GVEHb64YvuJoknIaMIpslqBF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/imagemagick/MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n  Copyright 1999-2021 ImageMagick Studio LLC, a non-profit organization\n  dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.\n\n  You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/imagemagick` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_FEHCxvkbql6yV37vEtslTEMP', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/imagemagick || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 2988\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:19 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     147 May 31  2025 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1746 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    5805 May 31  2025 AUTHORS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  126995 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   10738 May 31  2025 ImageMagick.spec.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2966 May 31  2025 Install-mac.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   28259 May 31  2025 Install-unix.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1144 May 31  2025 Install-vms.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     122 May 31  2025 Install-windows.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12478 May 31  2025 LICENSE\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 Magick++\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 MagickCore\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 MagickWand\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    8627 May 31  2025 Magickshr.opt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7685 May 31  2025 Make.com\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   11377 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1259411 May 31  2025 Makefile.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2057 May 31  2025 NEWS.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   12016 May 31  2025 NOTICE\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root    4096 May 31  2025 PerlMagick\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    4497 May 31  2025 QuickStart.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    9845 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    7386 May 31  2025 README.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     891 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   47329 May 31  2025 aclocal.m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 api_examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 app-image\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   12288 May 31  2025 coders\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1278 May 31  2025 common.shi.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 config\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1178579 May 31  2025 configure\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  133969 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 filters\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    4096 May 31  2025 images\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   17677 May 31  2025 index.html\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 m4\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    1567 May 31  2025 magick.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 scripts\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Dec 19 07:20 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 May 31  2025 utilities\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1789 May 31  2025 winpath.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    4096 May 31  2025 www"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_GVEHb64YvuJoknIaMIpslqBF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,240p' /src/imagemagick/MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n  Copyright 1999-2021 ImageMagick Studio LLC, a non-profit organization\n  dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.\n\n  You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
