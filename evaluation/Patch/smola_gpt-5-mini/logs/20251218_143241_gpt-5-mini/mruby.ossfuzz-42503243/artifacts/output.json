{"output": "Summary\n\nI fixed a heap-buffer-overflow in mrb_funcall_with_block (src/vm.c) where the VM failed to reserve enough stack space before copying arguments into the new call frame. The root cause was that the existing reservation mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3) did not account for the offset of the new callinfo->stack relative to the previous frame (the n value), so an 8-byte write could occur past the end of the allocated stack buffer.\n\nWhat I changed (minimal fix)\n\n- File modified: src/vm.c\n- Change: replaced a single call to mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3) with a call that includes the call frame offset:\n\nOriginal:\n    mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3);\n\nNew:\n    /* ensure there is enough room for the new callinfo's stack\n     * The new ci->stack is based on the previous ci->stack + n (number\n     * of regs used by the current frame). We must reserve space for\n     * that offset plus the incoming arguments and housekeeping slots.\n     */\n    mrb_stack_extend(mrb, n + argc + 3);\n\nRationale and analysis\n\n- Root cause: cipush creates a new callinfo whose ci->stack pointer is set to ci[-1].stack + push_stacks (here push_stacks is n). The code reserved argc + 3 slots, which was insufficient when ci->stack points inside the existing stack area past ci[-1].stack; copying arguments into ci->stack then wrote past the allocation end.\n\n- Minimal safe fix: Reserve space for n (the offset) plus argc + housekeeping slots, i.e. mrb_stack_extend(mrb, n + argc + 3). This ensures that, regardless of the relative base, there will be enough room to copy arguments and set up the call frame.\n\n- Alternatives considered:\n  1) Adjust cipush so push_stacks is interpreted differently or ensure callers compute push_stacks to reflect absolute positions. That would be more invasive and risks breaking callers.\n  2) Compute the absolute required stack size and compare/extend based on top of the highest used stack pointer. This is more complex.\n\nI selected the minimal change that directly addresses the missing reservation while keeping behavior otherwise unchanged.\n\nImplementation notes\n\n- The change is localized to src/vm.c (single-line replacement plus brief comment). No tests or non-source files were modified.\n\nVerification\n\nI ran the project's build and repro harness under the provided environment:\n- cd /src/mruby && secb build  \u2192 BUILD COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!\n- cd /src/mruby && secb repro   \u2192 The reproduced run finished with a NameError trace (uninitialized constant MissingConstant) but importantly did NOT trigger AddressSanitizer heap-buffer-overflow. The sanitizer crash from the original report is no longer triggered.\n\nFiles changed\n\n- src/vm.c (single small edit near mrb_funcall_with_block): changed one mrb_stack_extend call to include the n offset.\n\nNotes and recommendations\n\n- This is a minimal, targeted fix intended to prevent the immediate out-of-bounds write. It maintains current calling conventions and stack layout.\n- Further code-wide auditing could consider consolidating stack sizing computations in one helper or making cipush/stack allocation interactions clearer, but the present fix is small and low-risk.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Create a proper git commit (with an explanatory commit message) for this change.\n- Add a regression test that attempts the original problematic pattern to ensure continuous protection.\n\nDiff (context):\n--- a/src/vm.c\n+++ b/src/vm.c\n@@\n-    mrb_stack_extend(mrb, argc + 3);\n+    /* ensure there is enough room for the new callinfo's stack\n+     * The new ci->stack is based on the previous ci->stack + n (number\n+     * of regs used by the current frame).

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.", "task_images": null}, {"step_number": 1, "timing": {"start_time": 1768825871.0023267, "end_time": 1768825873.9960246, "duration": 2.9936978816986084}, "model_input_messages": [{"role": "system", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

This leads to heap corruption and can cause crashes or potentially enable arbitrary code execution.\n---\n==710==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x519000001380 at pc 0x555f7f378092 bp 0x7ffc547a87f0 sp 0x7ffc547a87e8\nWRITE of size 8 at 0x519000001380 thread T0\n    #0 0x555f7f378091 in mrb_funcall_with_block /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #1 0x555f7f3ca830 in const_get /src/mruby/src/variable.c:791:10\n    #2 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_const_get_sym /src/mruby/src/class.c:2392:10\n    #3 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_mod_const_get /src/mruby/src/class.c:2406:12\n    #4 0x555f7f38ef73 in mrb_vm_exec /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #5 0x555f7f37c84c in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1070:12\n    #6 0x555f7f3ec8c6 in mrb_load_exec /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6867:7\n    #7 0x555f7f3ed51d in mrb_load_detect_file_cxt /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6910:12\n    #8 0x555f7f32bcba in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:347:11\n    #9 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n    #10 0x555f7f25479d in _start (/src/mruby/build/host/bin/mruby+0x13879d)\n\n0x519000001380 is located 0 bytes after 1024-byte region [0x519000000f80,0x519000001380)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x555f7f2edb9c in realloc /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:82:3\n    #1 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc_simple /src/mruby/src/gc.c:226:8\n    #2 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:240:8\n    #3 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_malloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:256:10\n    #4 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_calloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:274:9\n    #5 0x555f7f37c66b in stack_init /src/mruby/src/vm.c:109:28\n    #6 0x555f7f37c66b in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1063:5\n    #7 0x555f7f42b4e9 in mrb_init_core /src/mruby/src/init.c:50:3\n    #8 0x555f7f359654 in mrb_core_init_protect /src/mruby/src/error.c:602:5\n    #9 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_core /src/mruby/src/state.c:52:7\n    #10 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_allocf /src/mruby/src/state.c:91:20\n    #11 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open /src/mruby/src/state.c:75:20\n    #12 0x555f7f32abcb in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:268:20\n    #13 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /src/mruby/src/vm.c in mrb_funcall_with_block\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x519000001100: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001180: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001200: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001280: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001300: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n=>0x519000001380:[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001400: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001480: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001500: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001580: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001600: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n==710==ABORTING\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/mruby` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}], "tool_calls": [{"id":

are an expert assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

This leads to heap corruption and can cause crashes or potentially enable arbitrary code execution.\n---\n==710==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x519000001380 at pc 0x555f7f378092 bp 0x7ffc547a87f0 sp 0x7ffc547a87e8\nWRITE of size 8 at 0x519000001380 thread T0\n    #0 0x555f7f378091 in mrb_funcall_with_block /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #1 0x555f7f3ca830 in const_get /src/mruby/src/variable.c:791:10\n    #2 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_const_get_sym /src/mruby/src/class.c:2392:10\n    #3 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_mod_const_get /src/mruby/src/class.c:2406:12\n    #4 0x555f7f38ef73 in mrb_vm_exec /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #5 0x555f7f37c84c in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1070:12\n    #6 0x555f7f3ec8c6 in mrb_load_exec /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6867:7\n    #7 0x555f7f3ed51d in mrb_load_detect_file_cxt /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6910:12\n    #8 0x555f7f32bcba in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:347:11\n    #9 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n    #10 0x555f7f25479d in _start (/src/mruby/build/host/bin/mruby+0x13879d)\n\n0x519000001380 is located 0 bytes after 1024-byte region [0x519000000f80,0x519000001380)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x555f7f2edb9c in realloc /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:82:3\n    #1 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc_simple /src/mruby/src/gc.c:226:8\n    #2 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:240:8\n    #3 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_malloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:256:10\n    #4 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_calloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:274:9\n    #5 0x555f7f37c66b in stack_init /src/mruby/src/vm.c:109:28\n    #6 0x555f7f37c66b in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1063:5\n    #7 0x555f7f42b4e9 in mrb_init_core /src/mruby/src/init.c:50:3\n    #8 0x555f7f359654 in mrb_core_init_protect /src/mruby/src/error.c:602:5\n    #9 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_core /src/mruby/src/state.c:52:7\n    #10 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_allocf /src/mruby/src/state.c:91:20\n    #11 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open /src/mruby/src/state.c:75:20\n    #12 0x555f7f32abcb in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:268:20\n    #13 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /src/mruby/src/vm.c in mrb_funcall_with_block\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x519000001100: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001180: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001200: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001280: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001300: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n=>0x519000001380:[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001400: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001480: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001500: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001580: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001600: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n==710==ABORTING\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/mruby` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/mruby\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/mruby`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

This leads to heap corruption and can cause crashes or potentially enable arbitrary code execution.\n---\n==710==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x519000001380 at pc 0x555f7f378092 bp 0x7ffc547a87f0 sp 0x7ffc547a87e8\nWRITE of size 8 at 0x519000001380 thread T0\n    #0 0x555f7f378091 in mrb_funcall_with_block /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #1 0x555f7f3ca830 in const_get /src/mruby/src/variable.c:791:10\n    #2 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_const_get_sym /src/mruby/src/class.c:2392:10\n    #3 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_mod_const_get /src/mruby/src/class.c:2406:12\n    #4 0x555f7f38ef73 in mrb_vm_exec /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #5 0x555f7f37c84c in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1070:12\n    #6 0x555f7f3ec8c6 in mrb_load_exec /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6867:7\n    #7 0x555f7f3ed51d in mrb_load_detect_file_cxt /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6910:12\n    #8 0x555f7f32bcba in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:347:11\n    #9 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n    #10 0x555f7f25479d in _start (/src/mruby/build/host/bin/mruby+0x13879d)\n\n0x519000001380 is located 0 bytes after 1024-byte region [0x519000000f80,0x519000001380)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x555f7f2edb9c in realloc /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:82:3\n    #1 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc_simple /src/mruby/src/gc.c:226:8\n    #2 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:240:8\n    #3 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_malloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:256:10\n    #4 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_calloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:274:9\n    #5 0x555f7f37c66b in stack_init /src/mruby/src/vm.c:109:28\n    #6 0x555f7f37c66b in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1063:5\n    #7 0x555f7f42b4e9 in mrb_init_core /src/mruby/src/init.c:50:3\n    #8 0x555f7f359654 in mrb_core_init_protect /src/mruby/src/error.c:602:5\n    #9 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_core /src/mruby/src/state.c:52:7\n    #10 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_allocf /src/mruby/src/state.c:91:20\n    #11 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open /src/mruby/src/state.c:75:20\n    #12 0x555f7f32abcb in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:268:20\n    #13 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /src/mruby/src/vm.c in mrb_funcall_with_block\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x519000001100: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001180: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001200: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001280: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001300: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n=>0x519000001380:[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001400: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001480: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001500: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001580: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001600: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n==710==ABORTING\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/mruby` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop.

You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

This leads to heap corruption and can cause crashes or potentially enable arbitrary code execution.\n---\n==710==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x519000001380 at pc 0x555f7f378092 bp 0x7ffc547a87f0 sp 0x7ffc547a87e8\nWRITE of size 8 at 0x519000001380 thread T0\n    #0 0x555f7f378091 in mrb_funcall_with_block /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #1 0x555f7f3ca830 in const_get /src/mruby/src/variable.c:791:10\n    #2 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_const_get_sym /src/mruby/src/class.c:2392:10\n    #3 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_mod_const_get /src/mruby/src/class.c:2406:12\n    #4 0x555f7f38ef73 in mrb_vm_exec /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #5 0x555f7f37c84c in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1070:12\n    #6 0x555f7f3ec8c6 in mrb_load_exec /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6867:7\n    #7 0x555f7f3ed51d in mrb_load_detect_file_cxt /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6910:12\n    #8 0x555f7f32bcba in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:347:11\n    #9 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n    #10 0x555f7f25479d in _start (/src/mruby/build/host/bin/mruby+0x13879d)\n\n0x519000001380 is located 0 bytes after 1024-byte region [0x519000000f80,0x519000001380)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x555f7f2edb9c in realloc /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:82:3\n    #1 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc_simple /src/mruby/src/gc.c:226:8\n    #2 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:240:8\n    #3 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_malloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:256:10\n    #4 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_calloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:274:9\n    #5 0x555f7f37c66b in stack_init /src/mruby/src/vm.c:109:28\n    #6 0x555f7f37c66b in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1063:5\n    #7 0x555f7f42b4e9 in mrb_init_core /src/mruby/src/init.c:50:3\n    #8 0x555f7f359654 in mrb_core_init_protect /src/mruby/src/error.c:602:5\n    #9 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_core /src/mruby/src/state.c:52:7\n    #10 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_allocf /src/mruby/src/state.c:91:20\n    #11 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open /src/mruby/src/state.c:75:20\n    #12 0x555f7f32abcb in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:268:20\n    #13 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /src/mruby/src/vm.c in mrb_funcall_with_block\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x519000001100: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001180: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001200: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001280: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001300: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n=>0x519000001380:[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001400: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001480: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001500: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001580: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001600: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n==710==ABORTING\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/mruby` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

This leads to heap corruption and can cause crashes or potentially enable arbitrary code execution.\n---\n==710==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x519000001380 at pc 0x555f7f378092 bp 0x7ffc547a87f0 sp 0x7ffc547a87e8\nWRITE of size 8 at 0x519000001380 thread T0\n    #0 0x555f7f378091 in mrb_funcall_with_block /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #1 0x555f7f3ca830 in const_get /src/mruby/src/variable.c:791:10\n    #2 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_const_get_sym /src/mruby/src/class.c:2392:10\n    #3 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_mod_const_get /src/mruby/src/class.c:2406:12\n    #4 0x555f7f38ef73 in mrb_vm_exec /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #5 0x555f7f37c84c in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1070:12\n    #6 0x555f7f3ec8c6 in mrb_load_exec /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6867:7\n    #7 0x555f7f3ed51d in mrb_load_detect_file_cxt /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6910:12\n    #8 0x555f7f32bcba in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:347:11\n    #9 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n    #10 0x555f7f25479d in _start (/src/mruby/build/host/bin/mruby+0x13879d)\n\n0x519000001380 is located 0 bytes after 1024-byte region [0x519000000f80,0x519000001380)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x555f7f2edb9c in realloc /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:82:3\n    #1 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc_simple /src/mruby/src/gc.c:226:8\n    #2 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:240:8\n    #3 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_malloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:256:10\n    #4 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_calloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:274:9\n    #5 0x555f7f37c66b in stack_init /src/mruby/src/vm.c:109:28\n    #6 0x555f7f37c66b in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1063:5\n    #7 0x555f7f42b4e9 in mrb_init_core /src/mruby/src/init.c:50:3\n    #8 0x555f7f359654 in mrb_core_init_protect /src/mruby/src/error.c:602:5\n    #9 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_core /src/mruby/src/state.c:52:7\n    #10 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_allocf /src/mruby/src/state.c:91:20\n    #11 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open /src/mruby/src/state.c:75:20\n    #12 0x555f7f32abcb in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:268:20\n    #13 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /src/mruby/src/vm.c in mrb_funcall_with_block\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x519000001100: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001180: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001200: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001280: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001300: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n=>0x519000001380:[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001400: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001480: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001500: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001580: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001600: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n==710==ABORTING\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/mruby` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

This leads to heap corruption and can cause crashes or potentially enable arbitrary code execution.\n---\n==710==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x519000001380 at pc 0x555f7f378092 bp 0x7ffc547a87f0 sp 0x7ffc547a87e8\nWRITE of size 8 at 0x519000001380 thread T0\n    #0 0x555f7f378091 in mrb_funcall_with_block /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #1 0x555f7f3ca830 in const_get /src/mruby/src/variable.c:791:10\n    #2 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_const_get_sym /src/mruby/src/class.c:2392:10\n    #3 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_mod_const_get /src/mruby/src/class.c:2406:12\n    #4 0x555f7f38ef73 in mrb_vm_exec /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #5 0x555f7f37c84c in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1070:12\n    #6 0x555f7f3ec8c6 in mrb_load_exec /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6867:7\n    #7 0x555f7f3ed51d in mrb_load_detect_file_cxt /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6910:12\n    #8 0x555f7f32bcba in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:347:11\n    #9 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n    #10 0x555f7f25479d in _start (/src/mruby/build/host/bin/mruby+0x13879d)\n\n0x519000001380 is located 0 bytes after 1024-byte region [0x519000000f80,0x519000001380)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x555f7f2edb9c in realloc /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:82:3\n    #1 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc_simple /src/mruby/src/gc.c:226:8\n    #2 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:240:8\n    #3 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_malloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:256:10\n    #4 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_calloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:274:9\n    #5 0x555f7f37c66b in stack_init /src/mruby/src/vm.c:109:28\n    #6 0x555f7f37c66b in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1063:5\n    #7 0x555f7f42b4e9 in mrb_init_core /src/mruby/src/init.c:50:3\n    #8 0x555f7f359654 in mrb_core_init_protect /src/mruby/src/error.c:602:5\n    #9 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_core /src/mruby/src/state.c:52:7\n    #10 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_allocf /src/mruby/src/state.c:91:20\n    #11 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open /src/mruby/src/state.c:75:20\n    #12 0x555f7f32abcb in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:268:20\n    #13 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /src/mruby/src/vm.c in mrb_funcall_with_block\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x519000001100: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001180: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001200: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001280: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001300: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n=>0x519000001380:[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001400: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001480: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001500: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001580: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001600: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n==710==ABORTING\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/mruby` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

This leads to heap corruption and can cause crashes or potentially enable arbitrary code execution.\n---\n==710==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x519000001380 at pc 0x555f7f378092 bp 0x7ffc547a87f0 sp 0x7ffc547a87e8\nWRITE of size 8 at 0x519000001380 thread T0\n    #0 0x555f7f378091 in mrb_funcall_with_block /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #1 0x555f7f3ca830 in const_get /src/mruby/src/variable.c:791:10\n    #2 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_const_get_sym /src/mruby/src/class.c:2392:10\n    #3 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_mod_const_get /src/mruby/src/class.c:2406:12\n    #4 0x555f7f38ef73 in mrb_vm_exec /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #5 0x555f7f37c84c in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1070:12\n    #6 0x555f7f3ec8c6 in mrb_load_exec /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6867:7\n    #7 0x555f7f3ed51d in mrb_load_detect_file_cxt /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6910:12\n    #8 0x555f7f32bcba in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:347:11\n    #9 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n    #10 0x555f7f25479d in _start (/src/mruby/build/host/bin/mruby+0x13879d)\n\n0x519000001380 is located 0 bytes after 1024-byte region [0x519000000f80,0x519000001380)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x555f7f2edb9c in realloc /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:82:3\n    #1 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc_simple /src/mruby/src/gc.c:226:8\n    #2 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:240:8\n    #3 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_malloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:256:10\n    #4 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_calloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:274:9\n    #5 0x555f7f37c66b in stack_init /src/mruby/src/vm.c:109:28\n    #6 0x555f7f37c66b in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1063:5\n    #7 0x555f7f42b4e9 in mrb_init_core /src/mruby/src/init.c:50:3\n    #8 0x555f7f359654 in mrb_core_init_protect /src/mruby/src/error.c:602:5\n    #9 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_core /src/mruby/src/state.c:52:7\n    #10 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_allocf /src/mruby/src/state.c:91:20\n    #11 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open /src/mruby/src/state.c:75:20\n    #12 0x555f7f32abcb in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:268:20\n    #13 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /src/mruby/src/vm.c in mrb_funcall_with_block\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x519000001100: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001180: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001200: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001280: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001300: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n=>0x519000001380:[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001400: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001480: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001500: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001580: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001600: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n==710==ABORTING\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/mruby` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

This leads to heap corruption and can cause crashes or potentially enable arbitrary code execution.\n---\n==710==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x519000001380 at pc 0x555f7f378092 bp 0x7ffc547a87f0 sp 0x7ffc547a87e8\nWRITE of size 8 at 0x519000001380 thread T0\n    #0 0x555f7f378091 in mrb_funcall_with_block /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #1 0x555f7f3ca830 in const_get /src/mruby/src/variable.c:791:10\n    #2 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_const_get_sym /src/mruby/src/class.c:2392:10\n    #3 0x555f7f3bd8b8 in mrb_mod_const_get /src/mruby/src/class.c:2406:12\n    #4 0x555f7f38ef73 in mrb_vm_exec /src/mruby/src/vm.c\n    #5 0x555f7f37c84c in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1070:12\n    #6 0x555f7f3ec8c6 in mrb_load_exec /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6867:7\n    #7 0x555f7f3ed51d in mrb_load_detect_file_cxt /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-compiler/core/parse.y:6910:12\n    #8 0x555f7f32bcba in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:347:11\n    #9 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n    #10 0x555f7f25479d in _start (/src/mruby/build/host/bin/mruby+0x13879d)\n\n0x519000001380 is located 0 bytes after 1024-byte region [0x519000000f80,0x519000001380)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x555f7f2edb9c in realloc /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:82:3\n    #1 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc_simple /src/mruby/src/gc.c:226:8\n    #2 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_realloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:240:8\n    #3 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_malloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:256:10\n    #4 0x555f7f34c07a in mrb_calloc /src/mruby/src/gc.c:274:9\n    #5 0x555f7f37c66b in stack_init /src/mruby/src/vm.c:109:28\n    #6 0x555f7f37c66b in mrb_vm_run /src/mruby/src/vm.c:1063:5\n    #7 0x555f7f42b4e9 in mrb_init_core /src/mruby/src/init.c:50:3\n    #8 0x555f7f359654 in mrb_core_init_protect /src/mruby/src/error.c:602:5\n    #9 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_core /src/mruby/src/state.c:52:7\n    #10 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open_allocf /src/mruby/src/state.c:91:20\n    #11 0x555f7f3ce8df in mrb_open /src/mruby/src/state.c:75:20\n    #12 0x555f7f32abcb in main /src/mruby/mrbgems/mruby-bin-mruby/tools/mruby/mruby.c:268:20\n    #13 0x7fb32e6df082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-FcRMwW/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /src/mruby/src/vm.c in mrb_funcall_with_block\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x519000001100: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001180: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001200: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001280: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001300: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n=>0x519000001380:[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001400: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa\n  0x519000001480: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001500: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001580: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x519000001600: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n==710==ABORTING\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/mruby` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":
