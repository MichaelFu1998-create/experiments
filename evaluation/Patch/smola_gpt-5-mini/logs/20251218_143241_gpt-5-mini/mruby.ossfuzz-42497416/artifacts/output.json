{"output": "Summary\n\nI found and fixed the crash in mrb_ary_shift_m by validating negative shift counts and raising an ArgumentError instead of allowing a negative value to be used in array pointer arithmetic.\n\nExploration\n\n- Located the function: src/array.c at mrb_ary_shift_m (around line 582 / later at ~614 reported in sanitizer).  Also found related uses of mrb_get_args(mrb, \"|i\", ...) in other files.\n- Reproduced the failure scenario: negative shift counts were accepted and then used to modify the array internal pointer (a->as.heap.ptr += n), allowing underflow/invalid pointer arithmetic and the AddressSanitizer SEGV shown in the issue description.\n\nAnalysis (possible approaches)\n\n1) Validate the argument at the start of mrb_ary_shift_m: if n < 0 raise an ArgumentError. This is minimal and consistent with existing array size checks in other methods (e.g., mrb_ary_first and mrb_ary_last raise on negative size).\n\n2) Convert negative n to a safe clamped value (e.g., treat negative as 0 or as length + n) or coerce into an unsigned range. This would change behavior and might be surprising; also it could still allow invalid pointer arithmetic if not handled carefully.\n\n3) Make all calls that accept a signed integer use an unsigned type internally and do a range check before performing pointer arithmetic. This is more invasive than needed for this single case.\n\nI chose approach 1 because it is minimal, keeps semantics consistent with similar APIs in the codebase (other functions validate sizes and raise on negative values), and directly prevents the unsafe pointer arithmetic that caused the crash.\n\nImplementation\n\n- Edited src/array.c in function mrb_ary_shift_m to add an explicit validation after ary_modify_check(mrb, a):\n\n    if (n < 0) {\n      mrb_raise(mrb, E_ARGUMENT_ERROR, \"negative array size\");\n    }\n\nThis prevents using negative n for pointer arithmetic and array construction.\n\nVerification\n\n- Built the project: cd /src/mruby && secb build -> BUILD COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!\n- Ran reproduction: cd /src/mruby && secb repro -> The repro now raises an ArgumentError: \"negative array size\" instead of producing an AddressSanitizer crash. The sanitizer error is no longer triggered.\n\nNotes and rationale\n\n- The change is minimal and limited to mrb_ary_shift_m; it mirrors validation in mrb_ary_first and mrb_ary_last which already raise on negative sizes.\n- This prevents the out-of-bounds / invalid memory access that led to the SEGV.\n\nIf you would like, I can:\n- Provide the exact patch/diff file produced\n- Audit other \"|i\" argument usages to ensure consistent negative-argument handling across other array-related methods (I noticed several other uses, but they already appear to handle negatives where appropriate)\n\nFiles changed (one-line summary)\n\n- src/array.c: added a negative-size check in mrb_ary_shift_m to raise ArgumentError for n < 0.\n\nStatus\n\n- The sanitizer crash reported in the issue description is no longer triggered by the repro; the code now raises ArgumentError for negative shift counts as expected.\n\nIf you want the git-style diff or want me to apply a different behavior (e.g., treat negative as zero), tell me which approach you prefer and I will update the implementation accordingly.", "steps": [{"task": "<uploaded_files>\n/src/mruby\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/mruby`.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1mMMeRgllJEIzXflz77ghqoa', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -nR \"mrb_ary_shift_m\" /src/mruby || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/src/mruby/src/array.c:582:mrb_ary_shift_m(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n/src/mruby/src/array.c:1362:  mrb_define_method(mrb, a, \"shift\",           mrb_ary_shift_m,      MRB_ARGS_OPT(1));   /* 15.2.12.5.27 */"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ZDvfolCsWE12M0fVEHGaKt2k', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '540,700p' /src/mruby/src/array.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nif (len == 0) return mrb_nil_value();\n  ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-1);\n  return ARY_PTR(a)[len-1];\n}\n\n#define ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN 10\n\nMRB_API mrb_value\nmrb_ary_shift(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n  mrb_value val;\n\n  ary_modify_check(mrb, a);\n  if (len == 0) return mrb_nil_value();\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)) {\n  L_SHIFT:\n    val = a->as.heap.ptr[0];\n    a->as.heap.ptr++;\n    a->as.heap.len--;\n    return val;\n  }\n  if (len > ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN) {\n    ary_make_shared(mrb, a);\n    goto L_SHIFT;\n  }\n  else {\n    mrb_value *ptr = ARY_PTR(a);\n    mrb_int size = len;\n\n    val = *ptr;\n    while (--size) {\n      *ptr = *(ptr+1);\n      ++ptr;\n    }\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-1);\n  }\n  return val;\n}\n\nstatic mrb_value\nmrb_ary_shift_m(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n  mrb_int n;\n  mrb_value val;\n\n  if (mrb_get_args(mrb, \"|i\", &n) == 0) {\n    return mrb_ary_shift(mrb, self);\n  };\n  ary_modify_check(mrb, a);\n  if (len == 0 || n == 0) return mrb_ary_new(mrb);\n  if (n > len) n = len;\n  val = mrb_ary_new_from_values(mrb, n, ARY_PTR(a));\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)) {\n  L_SHIFT:\n    a->as.heap.ptr+=n;\n    a->as.heap.len-=n;\n    return val;\n  }\n  if (len > ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN) {\n    ary_make_shared(mrb, a);\n    goto L_SHIFT;\n  }\n  else if (len == n) {\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, 0);\n  }\n  else {\n    mrb_value *ptr = ARY_PTR(a);\n    mrb_int size = len-n;\n\n    while (size--) {\n      *ptr = *(ptr+n);\n      ++ptr;\n    }\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-n);\n  }\n  return val;\n}\n\n/* self = [1,2,3]\n   item = 0\n   self.unshift item\n   p self #=> [0, 1, 2, 3] */\nMRB_API mrb_value\nmrb_ary_unshift(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self, mrb_value item)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)\n      && a->as.heap.aux.shared->refcnt == 1 /* shared only referenced from this array */\n      && a->as.heap.ptr -

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1mMMeRgllJEIzXflz77ghqoa', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -nR \"mrb_ary_shift_m\" /src/mruby || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/src/mruby/src/array.c:582:mrb_ary_shift_m(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n/src/mruby/src/array.c:1362:  mrb_define_method(mrb, a, \"shift\",           mrb_ary_shift_m,      MRB_ARGS_OPT(1));   /* 15.2.12.5.27 */"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ZDvfolCsWE12M0fVEHGaKt2k', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '540,700p' /src/mruby/src/array.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nif (len == 0) return mrb_nil_value();\n  ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-1);\n  return ARY_PTR(a)[len-1];\n}\n\n#define ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN 10\n\nMRB_API mrb_value\nmrb_ary_shift(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n  mrb_value val;\n\n  ary_modify_check(mrb, a);\n  if (len == 0) return mrb_nil_value();\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)) {\n  L_SHIFT:\n    val = a->as.heap.ptr[0];\n    a->as.heap.ptr++;\n    a->as.heap.len--;\n    return val;\n  }\n  if (len > ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN) {\n    ary_make_shared(mrb, a);\n    goto L_SHIFT;\n  }\n  else {\n    mrb_value *ptr = ARY_PTR(a);\n    mrb_int size = len;\n\n    val = *ptr;\n    while (--size) {\n      *ptr = *(ptr+1);\n      ++ptr;\n    }\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-1);\n  }\n  return val;\n}\n\nstatic mrb_value\nmrb_ary_shift_m(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n  mrb_int n;\n  mrb_value val;\n\n  if (mrb_get_args(mrb, \"|i\", &n) == 0) {\n    return mrb_ary_shift(mrb, self);\n  };\n  ary_modify_check(mrb, a);\n  if (len == 0 || n == 0) return mrb_ary_new(mrb);\n  if (n > len) n = len;\n  val = mrb_ary_new_from_values(mrb, n, ARY_PTR(a));\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)) {\n  L_SHIFT:\n    a->as.heap.ptr+=n;\n    a->as.heap.len-=n;\n    return val;\n  }\n  if (len > ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN) {\n    ary_make_shared(mrb, a);\n    goto L_SHIFT;\n  }\n  else if (len == n) {\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, 0);\n  }\n  else {\n    mrb_value *ptr = ARY_PTR(a);\n    mrb_int size = len-n;\n\n    while (size--) {\n      *ptr = *(ptr+n);\n      ++ptr;\n    }\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-n);\n  }\n  return val;\n}\n\n/* self = [1,2,3]\n   item = 0\n   self.unshift item\n   p self #=> [0, 1, 2, 3] */\nMRB_API mrb_value\nmrb_ary_unshift(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self, mrb_value item)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)\n      && a->as.heap.aux.shared->refcnt == 1 /* shared only referenced from this array */\n      && a->as.heap.ptr -

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1mMMeRgllJEIzXflz77ghqoa', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -nR \"mrb_ary_shift_m\" /src/mruby || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/src/mruby/src/array.c:582:mrb_ary_shift_m(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n/src/mruby/src/array.c:1362:  mrb_define_method(mrb, a, \"shift\",           mrb_ary_shift_m,      MRB_ARGS_OPT(1));   /* 15.2.12.5.27 */"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ZDvfolCsWE12M0fVEHGaKt2k', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '540,700p' /src/mruby/src/array.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nif (len == 0) return mrb_nil_value();\n  ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-1);\n  return ARY_PTR(a)[len-1];\n}\n\n#define ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN 10\n\nMRB_API mrb_value\nmrb_ary_shift(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n  mrb_value val;\n\n  ary_modify_check(mrb, a);\n  if (len == 0) return mrb_nil_value();\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)) {\n  L_SHIFT:\n    val = a->as.heap.ptr[0];\n    a->as.heap.ptr++;\n    a->as.heap.len--;\n    return val;\n  }\n  if (len > ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN) {\n    ary_make_shared(mrb, a);\n    goto L_SHIFT;\n  }\n  else {\n    mrb_value *ptr = ARY_PTR(a);\n    mrb_int size = len;\n\n    val = *ptr;\n    while (--size) {\n      *ptr = *(ptr+1);\n      ++ptr;\n    }\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-1);\n  }\n  return val;\n}\n\nstatic mrb_value\nmrb_ary_shift_m(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n  mrb_int n;\n  mrb_value val;\n\n  if (mrb_get_args(mrb, \"|i\", &n) == 0) {\n    return mrb_ary_shift(mrb, self);\n  };\n  ary_modify_check(mrb, a);\n  if (len == 0 || n == 0) return mrb_ary_new(mrb);\n  if (n > len) n = len;\n  val = mrb_ary_new_from_values(mrb, n, ARY_PTR(a));\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)) {\n  L_SHIFT:\n    a->as.heap.ptr+=n;\n    a->as.heap.len-=n;\n    return val;\n  }\n  if (len > ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN) {\n    ary_make_shared(mrb, a);\n    goto L_SHIFT;\n  }\n  else if (len == n) {\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, 0);\n  }\n  else {\n    mrb_value *ptr = ARY_PTR(a);\n    mrb_int size = len-n;\n\n    while (size--) {\n      *ptr = *(ptr+n);\n      ++ptr;\n    }\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-n);\n  }\n  return val;\n}\n\n/* self = [1,2,3]\n   item = 0\n   self.unshift item\n   p self #=> [0, 1, 2, 3] */\nMRB_API mrb_value\nmrb_ary_unshift(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self, mrb_value item)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)\n      && a->as.heap.aux.shared->refcnt == 1 /* shared only referenced from this array */\n      && a->as.heap.ptr -

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1mMMeRgllJEIzXflz77ghqoa', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -nR \"mrb_ary_shift_m\" /src/mruby || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/src/mruby/src/array.c:582:mrb_ary_shift_m(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n/src/mruby/src/array.c:1362:  mrb_define_method(mrb, a, \"shift\",           mrb_ary_shift_m,      MRB_ARGS_OPT(1));   /* 15.2.12.5.27 */"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ZDvfolCsWE12M0fVEHGaKt2k', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '540,700p' /src/mruby/src/array.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nif (len == 0) return mrb_nil_value();\n  ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-1);\n  return ARY_PTR(a)[len-1];\n}\n\n#define ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN 10\n\nMRB_API mrb_value\nmrb_ary_shift(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n  mrb_value val;\n\n  ary_modify_check(mrb, a);\n  if (len == 0) return mrb_nil_value();\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)) {\n  L_SHIFT:\n    val = a->as.heap.ptr[0];\n    a->as.heap.ptr++;\n    a->as.heap.len--;\n    return val;\n  }\n  if (len > ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN) {\n    ary_make_shared(mrb, a);\n    goto L_SHIFT;\n  }\n  else {\n    mrb_value *ptr = ARY_PTR(a);\n    mrb_int size = len;\n\n    val = *ptr;\n    while (--size) {\n      *ptr = *(ptr+1);\n      ++ptr;\n    }\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-1);\n  }\n  return val;\n}\n\nstatic mrb_value\nmrb_ary_shift_m(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n  mrb_int n;\n  mrb_value val;\n\n  if (mrb_get_args(mrb, \"|i\", &n) == 0) {\n    return mrb_ary_shift(mrb, self);\n  };\n  ary_modify_check(mrb, a);\n  if (len == 0 || n == 0) return mrb_ary_new(mrb);\n  if (n > len) n = len;\n  val = mrb_ary_new_from_values(mrb, n, ARY_PTR(a));\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)) {\n  L_SHIFT:\n    a->as.heap.ptr+=n;\n    a->as.heap.len-=n;\n    return val;\n  }\n  if (len > ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN) {\n    ary_make_shared(mrb, a);\n    goto L_SHIFT;\n  }\n  else if (len == n) {\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, 0);\n  }\n  else {\n    mrb_value *ptr = ARY_PTR(a);\n    mrb_int size = len-n;\n\n    while (size--) {\n      *ptr = *(ptr+n);\n      ++ptr;\n    }\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-n);\n  }\n  return val;\n}\n\n/* self = [1,2,3]\n   item = 0\n   self.unshift item\n   p self #=> [0, 1, 2, 3] */\nMRB_API mrb_value\nmrb_ary_unshift(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self, mrb_value item)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)\n      && a->as.heap.aux.shared->refcnt == 1 /* shared only referenced from this array */\n      && a->as.heap.ptr -

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1mMMeRgllJEIzXflz77ghqoa', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -nR \"mrb_ary_shift_m\" /src/mruby || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/src/mruby/src/array.c:582:mrb_ary_shift_m(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n/src/mruby/src/array.c:1362:  mrb_define_method(mrb, a, \"shift\",           mrb_ary_shift_m,      MRB_ARGS_OPT(1));   /* 15.2.12.5.27 */"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ZDvfolCsWE12M0fVEHGaKt2k', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '540,700p' /src/mruby/src/array.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nif (len == 0) return mrb_nil_value();\n  ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-1);\n  return ARY_PTR(a)[len-1];\n}\n\n#define ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN 10\n\nMRB_API mrb_value\nmrb_ary_shift(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n  mrb_value val;\n\n  ary_modify_check(mrb, a);\n  if (len == 0) return mrb_nil_value();\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)) {\n  L_SHIFT:\n    val = a->as.heap.ptr[0];\n    a->as.heap.ptr++;\n    a->as.heap.len--;\n    return val;\n  }\n  if (len > ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN) {\n    ary_make_shared(mrb, a);\n    goto L_SHIFT;\n  }\n  else {\n    mrb_value *ptr = ARY_PTR(a);\n    mrb_int size = len;\n\n    val = *ptr;\n    while (--size) {\n      *ptr = *(ptr+1);\n      ++ptr;\n    }\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-1);\n  }\n  return val;\n}\n\nstatic mrb_value\nmrb_ary_shift_m(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n  mrb_int n;\n  mrb_value val;\n\n  if (mrb_get_args(mrb, \"|i\", &n) == 0) {\n    return mrb_ary_shift(mrb, self);\n  };\n  ary_modify_check(mrb, a);\n  if (len == 0 || n == 0) return mrb_ary_new(mrb);\n  if (n > len) n = len;\n  val = mrb_ary_new_from_values(mrb, n, ARY_PTR(a));\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)) {\n  L_SHIFT:\n    a->as.heap.ptr+=n;\n    a->as.heap.len-=n;\n    return val;\n  }\n  if (len > ARY_SHIFT_SHARED_MIN) {\n    ary_make_shared(mrb, a);\n    goto L_SHIFT;\n  }\n  else if (len == n) {\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, 0);\n  }\n  else {\n    mrb_value *ptr = ARY_PTR(a);\n    mrb_int size = len-n;\n\n    while (size--) {\n      *ptr = *(ptr+n);\n      ++ptr;\n    }\n    ARY_SET_LEN(a, len-n);\n  }\n  return val;\n}\n\n/* self = [1,2,3]\n   item = 0\n   self.unshift item\n   p self #=> [0, 1, 2, 3] */\nMRB_API mrb_value\nmrb_ary_unshift(mrb_state *mrb, mrb_value self, mrb_value item)\n{\n  struct RArray *a = mrb_ary_ptr(self);\n  mrb_int len = ARY_LEN(a);\n\n  if (ARY_SHARED_P(a)\n      && a->as.heap.aux.shared->refcnt == 1 /* shared only referenced from this array */\n      && a->as.heap.ptr -
