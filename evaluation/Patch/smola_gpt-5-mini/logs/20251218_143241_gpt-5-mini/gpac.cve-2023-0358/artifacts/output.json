{"output": "Summary of work\n\nExploration\n- Searched for the function in the crash report and opened the implementation.\n- Files inspected: src/odf/descriptors.c and references from grep.\n- The crash stacktrace pointed to gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs in src/odf/descriptors.c around the parsing of vvcC NALU arrays.\n\nRoot cause analysis\n- In gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs the code created a GF_NALUFFParamArray *ar and unconditionally allocated it early, then read ar->type. If the type was invalid the code logged a warning and freed ar (gf_free(ar)). Later, regardless of whether ar was valid or freed, the code used ar->type (or a variable named type) to decide nalucount. This meant in the invalid-type path ar was freed then later referenced (use-after-free).\n- The sanitizer stack trace reported a heap-use-after-free inside gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs; this matches the pattern above.\n\nPossible fixes considered\n1) Delay allocation of ar until after reading the type and determining it's valid; only allocate when type is valid. This avoids freeing and then accessing the same structure.\n2) Keep allocation but copy ar->type into a local variable right after reading it and always use the local variable for subsequent decisions; ensure you don\u2019t access ar after freeing it. (Similar effect.)\n3) Add defensive checks before each use of ar to ensure it wasn't freed (e.g., check for NULL). This is heavier and more error-prone.\n\nSelected approach\n- Implemented the safe, minimal change: read the NALU array type into a local variable (type) before deciding whether to allocate ar. Allocate ar only when the type is a valid NALU type; set ar fields after allocation. Use the local type variable for subsequent logic so there is no access to a freed ar. This approach is minimal, avoids UAF, and keeps the logic clear.\n\nImplementation details (what I changed)\n- Edited src/odf/descriptors.c:\n  - In gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs I changed the parsing of the param_array entries so that:\n    - array_completeness and type are read into temporary local variables first.\n    - ar is only allocated (GF_SAFEALLOC) when the read type is one of the allowed GF_VVC_NALU_* types.\n    - ar fields (array_completeness, type, nalus) are set after successful allocation.\n    - subsequent logic uses the local type variable instead of ar->type when deciding nalucount or other flows.\n  - In gf_odf_vvc_cfg_write_bs I fixed a corresponding usage where code referenced a variable 'type' that did not exist in that scope (this was introduced during iterative edits). I restored/ensured the write function uses the proper ar->type where appropriate.\n- The changes are localized to src/odf/descriptors.c; no tests or other files were changed.\n\nVerification\n- I ran the project build: secb build (in /src/gpac) \u2014 build completed successfully.\n- I ran the reproducer: secb repro\n  - Output: the run logs show the invalid input is handled gracefully with warnings (\"Invalid NALU type in vvcC - ignoring\", \"Wrong param set size 0\", and \"Invalid IsoMedia File\"), and most importantly there is no AddressSanitizer heap-use-after-free abort. The reproducer exits reporting an invalid iso file for the testcase but without sanitizer crash.\n\nWhy this fixes the sanitizer error\n- The original UAF came from freeing ar in the default/invalid-case path and then later reading ar->type (or implicitly using the value) which accessed freed memory. By reading the type into a local variable first and only allocating ar when the type is valid, there is no path that frees ar and later accesses it: either we never allocate (and use the type local variable), or we allocate and keep using the allocated object.\n\nNotes and alternatives\n- Another valid minimal fix would be to allocate ar as now but immediately copy ar->type into a local variable and thereafter only use the local variable. The approach chosen (delay allocation until validity is known) avoids allocating/freeing unnecessarily and is clearer.\n- The code still logs and returns gracefully on malformed input. No behavior changes for valid inputs.\n\nFiles modified\n- src/odf/descriptors.c (small, localized edits in gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs and a small fix in gf_odf_vvc_cfg_write_bs to use the correct variable). The changes are minimal and limited to the single file handling vvc config parsing and writing.\n\nBuild & reproduction commands executed\n- secb build  (in /src/gpac) \u2014 build completed successfully\n- secb repro   (in /src/gpac) \u2014 reproducer runs and no AddressSanitizer crash is triggered; malformed input is handled with warnings instead of crashes.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Provide a unified patch/diff (git format-patch) showing the exact edits.\n- Run additional unit tests or fuzz harnesses if available.\n\nConclusion\n- The heap-use-after-free reported by AddressSanitizer in gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs has been fixed by removing the code path that allowed using an object after it was freed. The project builds successfully and the reproducer no longer triggers sanitizer errors.\n", "steps": [{"task": "<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.", "task_images": null}, {"step_number": 1, "timing": {"start_time": 1766048398.0369568, "end_time": 1766048399.5954602, "duration": 1.5585033893585205}, "model_input_messages": [{"role": "system", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}], "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "cmd", "arguments": {"command": "sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c"}}}], "error": null, "model_output_message": {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"_type": "ChatCompletionMessageToolCall"}], "raw": {"_type": "ModelResponse", "id": "chatcmpl-Co49Z4kbOyW8HmvteTS6VMMJEiC1W", "created": 1766048401, "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"_type": "Choices", "finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"_type": "Message", "content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"_type": "ChatCompletionMessageToolCall"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "_response_ms": 1672.166}, "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 4753, "output_tokens": 101, "total_tokens": 4854, "cost": 0.000254925}}, "model_output": null, "code_action": null, "observations": "/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

<issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_awcwAJ01CLZ1Hjp1T48Af69n', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 324\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   748 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 68550 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 75108 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 18 08:59 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3265 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9DcJ1RacSOPp2rjxg8sq6Y6J', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'grep -R \"gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs\" -n src || true'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:941:\tnew_cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/isomedia/avc_ext.c:3115:\tptr->config = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1294:GF_VVCConfig *gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(GF_BitStream *bs)\nsrc/odf/descriptors.c:1446:\tGF_VVCConfig *cfg = gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs(bs);\nsrc/export.cpp:710:#pragma comment (linker, EXPORT_SYMBOL(gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs) )"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xu8Y5iToRhB1UMBcd11D4bpj', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"sed -n '1,220p' src/odf/descriptors.c\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n/*\n *\t\t\tGPAC - Multimedia Framework C SDK\n *\n *\t\t\tAuthors: Jean Le Feuvre\n *\t\t\tCopyright (c) Telecom ParisTech 2000-2022\n *\t\t\t\t\tAll rights reserved\n *\n *  This file is part of GPAC / MPEG-4 ObjectDescriptor sub-project\n *\n *  GPAC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\n *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n *  any later version.\n *\n *  GPAC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

This is heavier and more error-prone.\n\nSelected approach\n- Implemented the safe, minimal change: read the NALU array type into a local variable (type) before deciding whether to allocate ar. Allocate ar only when the type is a valid NALU type; set ar fields after allocation. Use the local type variable for subsequent logic so there is no access to a freed ar. This approach is minimal, avoids UAF, and keeps the logic clear.\n\nImplementation details (what I changed)\n- Edited src/odf/descriptors.c:\n  - In gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs I changed the parsing of the param_array entries so that:\n    - array_completeness and type are read into temporary local variables first.\n    - ar is only allocated (GF_SAFEALLOC) when the read type is one of the allowed GF_VVC_NALU_* types.\n    - ar fields (array_completeness, type, nalus) are set after successful allocation.\n    - subsequent logic uses the local type variable instead of ar->type when deciding nalucount or other flows.\n  - In gf_odf_vvc_cfg_write_bs I fixed a corresponding usage where code referenced a variable 'type' that did not exist in that scope (this was introduced during iterative edits). I restored/ensured the write function uses the proper ar->type where appropriate.\n- The changes are localized to src/odf/descriptors.c; no tests or other files were changed.\n\nVerification\n- I ran the project build: secb build (in /src/gpac) \u2014 build completed successfully.\n- I ran the reproducer: secb repro\n  - Output: the run logs show the invalid input is handled gracefully with warnings (\"Invalid NALU type in vvcC - ignoring\", \"Wrong param set size 0\", and \"Invalid IsoMedia File\"), and most importantly there is no AddressSanitizer heap-use-after-free abort. The reproducer exits reporting an invalid iso file for the testcase but without sanitizer crash.\n\nWhy this fixes the sanitizer error\n- The original UAF came from freeing ar in the default/invalid-case path and then later reading ar->type (or implicitly using the value) which accessed freed memory. By reading the type into a local variable first and only allocating ar when the type is valid, there is no path that frees ar and later accesses it: either we never allocate (and use the type local variable), or we allocate and keep using the allocated object.\n\nNotes and alternatives\n- Another valid minimal fix would be to allocate ar as now but immediately copy ar->type into a local variable and thereafter only use the local variable. The approach chosen (delay allocation until validity is known) avoids allocating/freeing unnecessarily and is clearer.\n- The code still logs and returns gracefully on malformed input. No behavior changes for valid inputs.\n\nFiles modified\n- src/odf/descriptors.c (small, localized edits in gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs and a small fix in gf_odf_vvc_cfg_write_bs to use the correct variable). The changes are minimal and limited to the single file handling vvc config parsing and writing.\n\nBuild & reproduction commands executed\n- secb build  (in /src/gpac) \u2014 build completed successfully\n- secb repro   (in /src/gpac) \u2014 reproducer runs and no AddressSanitizer crash is triggered; malformed input is handled with warnings instead of crashes.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Provide a unified patch/diff (git format-patch) showing the exact edits.\n- Run additional unit tests or fuzz harnesses if available.\n\nConclusion\n- The heap-use-after-free reported by AddressSanitizer in gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs has been fixed by removing the code path that allowed using an object after it was freed. The project builds successfully and the reproducer no longer triggers sanitizer errors.\n"}}}], "error": null, "model_output_message": {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"_type": "ChatCompletionMessageToolCall"}], "raw": {"_type": "ModelResponse", "id": "chatcmpl-Co4CQ9rLN0kK4x6uOezUUe0oFxnME", "created": 1766048578, "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"_type": "Choices", "finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"_type": "Message", "content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"_type": "ChatCompletionMessageToolCall"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "_response_ms": 11301.484999999999}, "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 22880, "output_tokens": 1615, "total_tokens": 24495, "cost": 0.0008312}}, "model_output": null, "code_action": null, "observations": "Summary of work\n\nExploration\n- Searched for the function in the crash report and opened the implementation.\n- Files inspected: src/odf/descriptors.c and references from grep.\n- The crash stacktrace pointed to gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs in src/odf/descriptors.c around the parsing of vvcC NALU arrays.\n\nRoot cause analysis\n- In gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs the code created a GF_NALUFFParamArray *ar and unconditionally allocated it early, then read ar->type.

This approach is minimal, avoids UAF, and keeps the logic clear.\n\nImplementation details (what I changed)\n- Edited src/odf/descriptors.c:\n  - In gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs I changed the parsing of the param_array entries so that:\n    - array_completeness and type are read into temporary local variables first.\n    - ar is only allocated (GF_SAFEALLOC) when the read type is one of the allowed GF_VVC_NALU_* types.\n    - ar fields (array_completeness, type, nalus) are set after successful allocation.\n    - subsequent logic uses the local type variable instead of ar->type when deciding nalucount or other flows.\n  - In gf_odf_vvc_cfg_write_bs I fixed a corresponding usage where code referenced a variable 'type' that did not exist in that scope (this was introduced during iterative edits). I restored/ensured the write function uses the proper ar->type where appropriate.\n- The changes are localized to src/odf/descriptors.c; no tests or other files were changed.\n\nVerification\n- I ran the project build: secb build (in /src/gpac) \u2014 build completed successfully.\n- I ran the reproducer: secb repro\n  - Output: the run logs show the invalid input is handled gracefully with warnings (\"Invalid NALU type in vvcC - ignoring\", \"Wrong param set size 0\", and \"Invalid IsoMedia File\"), and most importantly there is no AddressSanitizer heap-use-after-free abort. The reproducer exits reporting an invalid iso file for the testcase but without sanitizer crash.\n\nWhy this fixes the sanitizer error\n- The original UAF came from freeing ar in the default/invalid-case path and then later reading ar->type (or implicitly using the value) which accessed freed memory. By reading the type into a local variable first and only allocating ar when the type is valid, there is no path that frees ar and later accesses it: either we never allocate (and use the type local variable), or we allocate and keep using the allocated object.\n\nNotes and alternatives\n- Another valid minimal fix would be to allocate ar as now but immediately copy ar->type into a local variable and thereafter only use the local variable. The approach chosen (delay allocation until validity is known) avoids allocating/freeing unnecessarily and is clearer.\n- The code still logs and returns gracefully on malformed input. No behavior changes for valid inputs.\n\nFiles modified\n- src/odf/descriptors.c (small, localized edits in gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs and a small fix in gf_odf_vvc_cfg_write_bs to use the correct variable). The changes are minimal and limited to the single file handling vvc config parsing and writing.\n\nBuild & reproduction commands executed\n- secb build  (in /src/gpac) \u2014 build completed successfully\n- secb repro   (in /src/gpac) \u2014 reproducer runs and no AddressSanitizer crash is triggered; malformed input is handled with warnings instead of crashes.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Provide a unified patch/diff (git format-patch) showing the exact edits.\n- Run additional unit tests or fuzz harnesses if available.\n\nConclusion\n- The heap-use-after-free reported by AddressSanitizer in gf_odf_vvc_cfg_read_bs has been fixed by removing the code path that allowed using an object after it was freed. The project builds successfully and the reproducer no longer triggers sanitizer errors.", "observations_images": null, "action_output": null, "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 22880, "output_tokens": 1615, "total_tokens": 24495, "cost": 0.0008312}, "is_final_answer": true}]}
