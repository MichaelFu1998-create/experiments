{"output": "Implemented minimal bounds-checking fixes to prevent the reported ASan global-buffer-overflow crashes.\n\n## What was crashing / why\n- **liblouis/logging.c (`lou_logFile`)**: `initialLogFileName` is a fixed 256-byte global buffer, but the code did `strcpy(initialLogFileName, fileName);`, allowing an attacker-controlled long filename to overflow it.\n- **liblouis/compileTranslationTable.c (`lou_setDataPath`)**: `dataPath` is a fixed `MAXSTRING` buffer, but the code did `strcpy(dataPath, path);`, allowing overflow with an overly long path.\n\n## Fix approach chosen\nUse bounded writes and explicit length checks (minimal code churn, preserves behavior):\n- Replace `strcpy` with `snprintf`.\n- Add a length check in `lou_setDataPath` and return `NULL` on too-long input (also logs an error).\n\n## Changes made\n### 1) `liblouis/logging.c`\nReplaced the unsafe copy into `initialLogFileName`:\n- **Before**: `strcpy(initialLogFileName, fileName);`\n- **After**: `snprintf(initialLogFileName, sizeof(initialLogFileName), \"%s\", fileName);`\n\n### 2) `liblouis/compileTranslationTable.c`\nAdded length validation and bounded copy in `lou_setDataPath`:\n- Reject paths where `strlen(path) >= sizeof(dataPath)` and return `NULL`.\n- Use `snprintf(dataPath, sizeof(dataPath), \"%s\", path);`.\n\n## Verification\n- `secb build` \u2705\n- `secb repro` \u2705 (exits 0; sanitizer error no longer triggered)\n\nThese are minimal, focused changes in non-test source files, directly addressing the crash points described.", "steps": [{"task": "<uploaded_files>\n/src/liblouis\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/liblouis`.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/liblouis\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/liblouis`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/liblouis` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/liblouis\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/liblouis`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/liblouis` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/liblouis` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6JAr17DuNDAOh0fIyB3ikwHb', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/liblouis && find /src/liblouis -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 584\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 13:40 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2608 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     80 May 31  2025 .dir-locals.el\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5821 May 31  2025 .dockerignore\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6550 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4496 May 31  2025 ANNOUNCEMENT\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   9057 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  26530 May 31  2025 COPYING.LESSER\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  51791 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    637 May 31  2025 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2682 May 31  2025 Dockerfile.win32\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2263 May 31  2025 Dockerfile.win64\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 107244 May 31  2025 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  15475 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  26461 May 31  2025 License.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1129 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 129697 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4927 May 31  2025 README\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      6 May 31  2025 README.org -> README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1420 May 31  2025 README.windows\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2668 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1424 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   7934 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 contrib\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 extra\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 gnulib\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 liblouis\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    283 May 31  2025 liblouis.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    704 May 31  2025 libyaml_mingw.patch\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 man\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 python\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 13:40 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  20480 May 31  2025 tables\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 tools\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 windows\n/src/liblouis/.clang-format\n/src/liblouis/doc/Makefile.am\n/src/liblouis/doc/liblouis.texi\n/src/liblouis/.github/FUNDING.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/cifuzz.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/fuzzing.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/metadata.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/macro.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/main.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/check-table-license.yml"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_W8u6hivOUoEFrbx7XjmTLoIi', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'cd /src/liblouis && find . -maxdepth 4 -type f \\\\( -name \"*compileTranslationTable*\" -o -name \"compileTranslationTable.c\" -o -name \"logging.c\" -o -name \"*dataPath*\" \\\\) -print && grep -RIn \"lou_setDataPath\" -n . | head -n 50 && grep -RIn \"initialLogFileName\" -n . | head -n 50\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n./liblouis/compileTranslationTable.c\n./liblouis/logging.c\n./tests/logging.c\n./doc/liblouis.texi:192:* lou_setDataPath::\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3250:* lou_setDataPath::\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3888:@node lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3889:@section lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3890:@findex lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3893:char *lou_setDataPath (\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3912:@code{lou_setDataPath}.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/liblouis` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6JAr17DuNDAOh0fIyB3ikwHb', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/liblouis && find /src/liblouis -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 584\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 13:40 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2608 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     80 May 31  2025 .dir-locals.el\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5821 May 31  2025 .dockerignore\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6550 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4496 May 31  2025 ANNOUNCEMENT\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   9057 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  26530 May 31  2025 COPYING.LESSER\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  51791 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    637 May 31  2025 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2682 May 31  2025 Dockerfile.win32\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2263 May 31  2025 Dockerfile.win64\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 107244 May 31  2025 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  15475 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  26461 May 31  2025 License.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1129 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 129697 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4927 May 31  2025 README\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      6 May 31  2025 README.org -> README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1420 May 31  2025 README.windows\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2668 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1424 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   7934 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 contrib\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 extra\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 gnulib\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 liblouis\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    283 May 31  2025 liblouis.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    704 May 31  2025 libyaml_mingw.patch\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 man\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 python\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 13:40 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  20480 May 31  2025 tables\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 tools\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 windows\n/src/liblouis/.clang-format\n/src/liblouis/doc/Makefile.am\n/src/liblouis/doc/liblouis.texi\n/src/liblouis/.github/FUNDING.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/cifuzz.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/fuzzing.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/metadata.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/macro.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/main.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/check-table-license.yml"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_W8u6hivOUoEFrbx7XjmTLoIi', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'cd /src/liblouis && find . -maxdepth 4 -type f \\\\( -name \"*compileTranslationTable*\" -o -name \"compileTranslationTable.c\" -o -name \"logging.c\" -o -name \"*dataPath*\" \\\\) -print && grep -RIn \"lou_setDataPath\" -n . | head -n 50 && grep -RIn \"initialLogFileName\" -n . | head -n 50\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n./liblouis/compileTranslationTable.c\n./liblouis/logging.c\n./tests/logging.c\n./doc/liblouis.texi:192:* lou_setDataPath::\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3250:* lou_setDataPath::\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3888:@node lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3889:@section lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3890:@findex lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3893:char *lou_setDataPath (\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3912:@code{lou_setDataPath}.

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/liblouis\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/liblouis`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/liblouis` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6JAr17DuNDAOh0fIyB3ikwHb', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/liblouis && find /src/liblouis -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 584\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 13:40 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2608 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     80 May 31  2025 .dir-locals.el\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5821 May 31  2025 .dockerignore\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6550 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4496 May 31  2025 ANNOUNCEMENT\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   9057 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  26530 May 31  2025 COPYING.LESSER\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  51791 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    637 May 31  2025 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2682 May 31  2025 Dockerfile.win32\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2263 May 31  2025 Dockerfile.win64\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 107244 May 31  2025 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  15475 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  26461 May 31  2025 License.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1129 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 129697 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4927 May 31  2025 README\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      6 May 31  2025 README.org -> README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1420 May 31  2025 README.windows\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2668 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1424 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   7934 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 contrib\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 extra\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 gnulib\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 liblouis\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    283 May 31  2025 liblouis.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    704 May 31  2025 libyaml_mingw.patch\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 man\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 python\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 13:40 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  20480 May 31  2025 tables\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 tools\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 windows\n/src/liblouis/.clang-format\n/src/liblouis/doc/Makefile.am\n/src/liblouis/doc/liblouis.texi\n/src/liblouis/.github/FUNDING.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/cifuzz.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/fuzzing.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/metadata.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/macro.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/main.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/check-table-license.yml"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_W8u6hivOUoEFrbx7XjmTLoIi', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'cd /src/liblouis && find . -maxdepth 4 -type f \\\\( -name \"*compileTranslationTable*\" -o -name \"compileTranslationTable.c\" -o -name \"logging.c\" -o -name \"*dataPath*\" \\\\) -print && grep -RIn \"lou_setDataPath\" -n . | head -n 50 && grep -RIn \"initialLogFileName\" -n . | head -n 50\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n./liblouis/compileTranslationTable.c\n./liblouis/logging.c\n./tests/logging.c\n./doc/liblouis.texi:192:* lou_setDataPath::\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3250:* lou_setDataPath::\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3888:@node lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3889:@section lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3890:@findex lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3893:char *lou_setDataPath (\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3912:@code{lou_setDataPath}.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/liblouis` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6JAr17DuNDAOh0fIyB3ikwHb', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/liblouis && find /src/liblouis -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 584\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 13:40 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2608 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     80 May 31  2025 .dir-locals.el\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5821 May 31  2025 .dockerignore\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6550 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4496 May 31  2025 ANNOUNCEMENT\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   9057 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  26530 May 31  2025 COPYING.LESSER\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  51791 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    637 May 31  2025 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2682 May 31  2025 Dockerfile.win32\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2263 May 31  2025 Dockerfile.win64\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 107244 May 31  2025 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  15475 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  26461 May 31  2025 License.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1129 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 129697 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4927 May 31  2025 README\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      6 May 31  2025 README.org -> README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1420 May 31  2025 README.windows\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2668 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1424 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   7934 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 contrib\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 extra\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 gnulib\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 liblouis\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    283 May 31  2025 liblouis.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    704 May 31  2025 libyaml_mingw.patch\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 man\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 python\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 13:40 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  20480 May 31  2025 tables\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 tools\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 windows\n/src/liblouis/.clang-format\n/src/liblouis/doc/Makefile.am\n/src/liblouis/doc/liblouis.texi\n/src/liblouis/.github/FUNDING.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/cifuzz.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/fuzzing.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/metadata.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/macro.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/main.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/check-table-license.yml"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_W8u6hivOUoEFrbx7XjmTLoIi', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'cd /src/liblouis && find . -maxdepth 4 -type f \\\\( -name \"*compileTranslationTable*\" -o -name \"compileTranslationTable.c\" -o -name \"logging.c\" -o -name \"*dataPath*\" \\\\) -print && grep -RIn \"lou_setDataPath\" -n . | head -n 50 && grep -RIn \"initialLogFileName\" -n . | head -n 50\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n./liblouis/compileTranslationTable.c\n./liblouis/logging.c\n./tests/logging.c\n./doc/liblouis.texi:192:* lou_setDataPath::\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3250:* lou_setDataPath::\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3888:@node lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3889:@section lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3890:@findex lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3893:char *lou_setDataPath (\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3912:@code{lou_setDataPath}.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/liblouis` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_6JAr17DuNDAOh0fIyB3ikwHb', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/liblouis && find /src/liblouis -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 584\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 13:40 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2608 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     80 May 31  2025 .dir-locals.el\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5821 May 31  2025 .dockerignore\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6550 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4496 May 31  2025 ANNOUNCEMENT\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   9057 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  26530 May 31  2025 COPYING.LESSER\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  51791 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    637 May 31  2025 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2682 May 31  2025 Dockerfile.win32\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2263 May 31  2025 Dockerfile.win64\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 107244 May 31  2025 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  15475 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  26461 May 31  2025 License.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1129 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 129697 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4927 May 31  2025 README\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      6 May 31  2025 README.org -> README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1420 May 31  2025 README.windows\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2668 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1424 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   7934 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 contrib\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 extra\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 May 31  2025 gnulib\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 liblouis\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    283 May 31  2025 liblouis.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    704 May 31  2025 libyaml_mingw.patch\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 man\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 python\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 13:40 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  20480 May 31  2025 tables\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 tests\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 tools\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 windows\n/src/liblouis/.clang-format\n/src/liblouis/doc/Makefile.am\n/src/liblouis/doc/liblouis.texi\n/src/liblouis/.github/FUNDING.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/cifuzz.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/fuzzing.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/metadata.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/macro.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/main.yml\n/src/liblouis/.github/workflows/check-table-license.yml"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_W8u6hivOUoEFrbx7XjmTLoIi', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'cd /src/liblouis && find . -maxdepth 4 -type f \\\\( -name \"*compileTranslationTable*\" -o -name \"compileTranslationTable.c\" -o -name \"logging.c\" -o -name \"*dataPath*\" \\\\) -print && grep -RIn \"lou_setDataPath\" -n . | head -n 50 && grep -RIn \"initialLogFileName\" -n . | head -n 50\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n./liblouis/compileTranslationTable.c\n./liblouis/logging.c\n./tests/logging.c\n./doc/liblouis.texi:192:* lou_setDataPath::\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3250:* lou_setDataPath::\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3888:@node lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3889:@section lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3890:@findex lou_setDataPath\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3893:char *lou_setDataPath (\n./doc/liblouis.texi:3912:@code{lou_setDataPath}.
