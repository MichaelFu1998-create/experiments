{"output": "Implemented a minimal, focused fix for the reported heap-buffer-overflow in `htmlescape` (and the closely-related `htmlwescape`) in `/src/libredwg/programs/escape.c`.\n\n## Root cause\nThe old implementation used `strcat(d, \"...\")` while `d` pointed into freshly `malloc`/`realloc`\u2019d memory that was not guaranteed to be NUL-terminated at that position. `strcat` first scans for a `\\0`, so it could read past the allocated heap buffer, triggering the ASan heap-buffer-overflow shown at `../../programs/escape.c:48`.\n\n## Fix approach (chosen)\nReplace `strcat`-based appending with explicit bounds-checked appends:\n- Always keep the output buffer NUL-terminated.\n- Before writing, ensure capacity for the number of bytes to be appended (+1 for the terminator).\n- Use `memcpy` to append literals.\n- Keep `sprintf` but only after ensuring enough space.\n- Handle `NULL` input safely.\n\nThis is a minimal change isolated to `programs/escape.c` (non-test code) and does not alter external APIs.\n\n## What changed\n- Rewrote `htmlescape()` to append using safe helpers (`ensure_space`, `append_lit`) instead of `strcat`.\n- Updated `htmlwescape()` similarly (it had the same unsafe pattern).\n\n## Verification\n- `secb build` succeeds.\n- `secb repro` no longer triggers any sanitizer errors; it produces SVG output successfully.\n\nFiles modified:\n- `programs/escape.c`", "steps": [{"task": "<uploaded_files>\n/src/libredwg\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/libredwg`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/libredwg\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/libredwg`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ALRPOlqtDrt8A38JqV9jBIhD', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 May 31  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 May 31  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 May 31  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 May 31  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 May 31  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 May 31  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 May 31  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 May 31  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 May 31  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 May 31  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 May 31  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 May 31  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 May 31  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 May 31  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 May 31  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 May 31  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 May 31  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 May 31  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 May 31  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xYvXHVnbNuCXgmatIAAiVl94', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"cd /src/libredwg && find programs -maxdepth 2 -type f -name 'escape.c' -o -name 'dwg2SVG.c' -print && sed -n '1,120p' programs/escape.c && nl -ba programs/escape.c | sed -n '1,120p'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nprograms/dwg2SVG.c\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG - free implementation of the DWG file format                    */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.                        */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  This library is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU       */\n/*  General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,     */\n/*  either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  */\n/*  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License        */\n/*  along with this program.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/libredwg\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/libredwg`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ALRPOlqtDrt8A38JqV9jBIhD', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 May 31  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 May 31  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 May 31  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 May 31  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 May 31  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 May 31  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 May 31  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 May 31  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 May 31  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 May 31  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 May 31  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 May 31  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 May 31  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 May 31  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 May 31  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 May 31  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 May 31  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 May 31  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 May 31  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xYvXHVnbNuCXgmatIAAiVl94', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"cd /src/libredwg && find programs -maxdepth 2 -type f -name 'escape.c' -o -name 'dwg2SVG.c' -print && sed -n '1,120p' programs/escape.c && nl -ba programs/escape.c | sed -n '1,120p'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nprograms/dwg2SVG.c\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG - free implementation of the DWG file format                    */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.                        */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  This library is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU       */\n/*  General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,     */\n/*  either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  */\n/*  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License        */\n/*  along with this program.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ALRPOlqtDrt8A38JqV9jBIhD', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 May 31  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 May 31  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 May 31  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 May 31  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 May 31  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 May 31  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 May 31  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 May 31  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 May 31  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 May 31  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 May 31  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 May 31  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 May 31  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 May 31  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 May 31  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 May 31  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 May 31  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 May 31  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 May 31  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xYvXHVnbNuCXgmatIAAiVl94', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"cd /src/libredwg && find programs -maxdepth 2 -type f -name 'escape.c' -o -name 'dwg2SVG.c' -print && sed -n '1,120p' programs/escape.c && nl -ba programs/escape.c | sed -n '1,120p'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nprograms/dwg2SVG.c\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG - free implementation of the DWG file format                    */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.                        */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  This library is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU       */\n/*  General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,     */\n/*  either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  */\n/*  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License        */\n/*  along with this program.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ALRPOlqtDrt8A38JqV9jBIhD', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 May 31  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 May 31  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 May 31  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 May 31  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 May 31  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 May 31  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 May 31  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 May 31  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 May 31  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 May 31  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 May 31  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 May 31  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 May 31  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 May 31  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 May 31  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 May 31  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 May 31  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 May 31  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 May 31  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xYvXHVnbNuCXgmatIAAiVl94', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"cd /src/libredwg && find programs -maxdepth 2 -type f -name 'escape.c' -o -name 'dwg2SVG.c' -print && sed -n '1,120p' programs/escape.c && nl -ba programs/escape.c | sed -n '1,120p'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nprograms/dwg2SVG.c\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG - free implementation of the DWG file format                    */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.                        */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  This library is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU       */\n/*  General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,     */\n/*  either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  */\n/*  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License        */\n/*  along with this program.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ALRPOlqtDrt8A38JqV9jBIhD', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 May 31  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 May 31  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 May 31  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 May 31  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 May 31  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 May 31  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 May 31  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 May 31  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 May 31  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 May 31  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 May 31  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 May 31  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 May 31  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 May 31  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 May 31  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 May 31  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 May 31  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 May 31  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 May 31  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xYvXHVnbNuCXgmatIAAiVl94', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"cd /src/libredwg && find programs -maxdepth 2 -type f -name 'escape.c' -o -name 'dwg2SVG.c' -print && sed -n '1,120p' programs/escape.c && nl -ba programs/escape.c | sed -n '1,120p'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nprograms/dwg2SVG.c\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG - free implementation of the DWG file format                    */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.                        */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  This library is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU       */\n/*  General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,     */\n/*  either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  */\n/*  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License        */\n/*  along with this program.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ALRPOlqtDrt8A38JqV9jBIhD', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 May 31  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 May 31  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 May 31  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 May 31  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 May 31  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 May 31  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 May 31  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 May 31  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 May 31  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 May 31  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 May 31  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 May 31  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 May 31  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 May 31  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 May 31  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 May 31  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 May 31  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 May 31  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 May 31  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xYvXHVnbNuCXgmatIAAiVl94', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"cd /src/libredwg && find programs -maxdepth 2 -type f -name 'escape.c' -o -name 'dwg2SVG.c' -print && sed -n '1,120p' programs/escape.c && nl -ba programs/escape.c | sed -n '1,120p'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nprograms/dwg2SVG.c\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG - free implementation of the DWG file format                    */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.                        */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  This library is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU       */\n/*  General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,     */\n/*  either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  */\n/*  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License        */\n/*  along with this program.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ALRPOlqtDrt8A38JqV9jBIhD', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 May 31  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 May 31  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 May 31  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 May 31  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 May 31  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 May 31  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 May 31  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 May 31  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 May 31  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 May 31  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 May 31  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 May 31  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 May 31  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 May 31  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 May 31  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 May 31  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 May 31  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 May 31  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 May 31  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xYvXHVnbNuCXgmatIAAiVl94', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"cd /src/libredwg && find programs -maxdepth 2 -type f -name 'escape.c' -o -name 'dwg2SVG.c' -print && sed -n '1,120p' programs/escape.c && nl -ba programs/escape.c | sed -n '1,120p'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nprograms/dwg2SVG.c\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG - free implementation of the DWG file format                    */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.                        */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  This library is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU       */\n/*  General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,     */\n/*  either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  */\n/*  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License        */\n/*  along with this program.

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/libredwg\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/libredwg`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/libredwg` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_ALRPOlqtDrt8A38JqV9jBIhD', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/libredwg'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 748\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 May 31  2025 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4438 May 31  2025 .appveyor.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    707 May 31  2025 .cirrus.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    129 May 31  2025 .clang-format\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    803 May 31  2025 .drone.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root   4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2616 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    166 May 31  2025 .gitlab-ci.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    264 May 31  2025 .lgtm.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1887 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1539 May 31  2025 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6021 May 31  2025 CONTRIBUTING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 467792 May 31  2025 ChangeLog\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14702 May 31  2025 HACKING\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5728 May 31  2025 Makefile.am\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18891 May 31  2025 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6839 May 31  2025 README\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4483 May 31  2025 TODO\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5305 May 31  2025 USING_FOREIGN_CODE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    661 May 31  2025 autogen.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 31  2025 bindings\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 build-aux\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  19638 May 31  2025 configure.ac\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1035 May 31  2025 dwg.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1903 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.lsp\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1003 May 31  2025 dxf-allcvt.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1032 May 31  2025 dxf-check\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   1413 May 31  2025 dxf-roundtrip.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    991 May 31  2025 dxf.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    271 May 31  2025 libredwg.pc.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    859 May 31  2025 log.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    616 May 31  2025 logs-all-parallel.sh.in\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    936 May 31  2025 logs-all-serial.sh.in\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 m4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 programs\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Dec 31 21:30 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 31  2025 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root   4096 May 31  2025 test\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    730 May 31  2025 test-dxf.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    258 May 31  2025 unknown.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2087 May 31  2025 valgrind-darwin.supp\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1100 May 31  2025 valgrind-linux.supp"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_xYvXHVnbNuCXgmatIAAiVl94', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"cd /src/libredwg && find programs -maxdepth 2 -type f -name 'escape.c' -o -name 'dwg2SVG.c' -print && sed -n '1,120p' programs/escape.c && nl -ba programs/escape.c | sed -n '1,120p'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nprograms/dwg2SVG.c\n/*****************************************************************************/\n/*  LibreDWG - free implementation of the DWG file format                    */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.                        */\n/*                                                                           */\n/*  This library is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU       */\n/*  General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,     */\n/*  either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  */\n/*  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License        */\n/*  along with this program.
