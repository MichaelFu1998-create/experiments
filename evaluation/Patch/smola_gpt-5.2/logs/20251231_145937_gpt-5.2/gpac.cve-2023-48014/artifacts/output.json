{"output": "Implemented a minimal fix for the stack-buffer-overflow in `hevc_parse_vps_extension` (`src/media_tools/av_parsers.c`).\n\n### Root cause\n`dim_bit_offset` was declared as `u8 dim_bit_offset[16]`, but the code writes to `dim_bit_offset[num_scalability_types]` when `splitting_flag` is set. Since `num_scalability_types` is clamped to 16, this becomes an out-of-bounds write to index 16 (17th element), matching the ASan report.\n\n### Fix\n- Increased the size of `dim_bit_offset` from 16 to 17 to safely allow indexing up to `[16]`.\n- Added a short comment explaining the inclusive indexing.\n\n### Verification\n- `secb build` succeeds.\n- `secb repro` no longer triggers the AddressSanitizer stack-buffer-overflow; the previous crash point is resolved.", "steps": [{"task": "<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.", "task_images": null}, {"step_number": 1, "timing": {"start_time": 1767175490.700693, "end_time": 1767175492.5152392, "duration": 1.8145463466644287}, "model_input_messages": [{"role": "system", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}], "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_LdOV3inO9BqfUWkYEqaajmLV", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "cmd", "arguments": {"command": "ls -la /src/gpac && find /src/gpac -maxdepth 3 -type f | head"}}}], "error": null, "model_output_message": {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"_type": "ChatCompletionMessageToolCall"}], "raw": {"_type": "ModelResponse", "id": "chatcmpl-CsnMRRkvssgEUlMqYDEmxgKsZo2jQ", "created": 1767175491, "model": "gpt-5.2-2025-12-11", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"_type": "Choices", "finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"_type": "Message", "content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"_type": "ChatCompletionMessageToolCall"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "_response_ms": 1783.258}, "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 3692, "output_tokens": 95, "total_tokens": 3787, "cost": 0.007175}}, "model_output": null, "code_action": null, "observations": "total 348\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 31 10:04 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   747 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 70426 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 87490 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   567 May 31  2025 flake.lock\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1229 May 31  2025 flake.nix\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 20 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 31 10:04 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3469 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat\n/src/gpac/include/wince/errno.h\n/src/gpac/include/win32/inttypes.h\n/src/gpac/include/win32/stdint.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/nodes_svg.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/sync_layer.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/bitstream.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/route.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/list.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/network.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/path2d.h", "observations_images": null, "action_output": null, "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 3692, "output_tokens": 95, "total_tokens": 3787, "cost": 0.007175}, "is_final_answer": false}, {"step_number": 2, "timing": {"start_time": 1767175492.515629, "end_time": 1767175493.8724358, "duration": 1.356806755065918}, "model_input_messages": [{"role": "system", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_LdOV3inO9BqfUWkYEqaajmLV', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac && find /src/gpac -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 348\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 31 10:04 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   747 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 70426 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 87490 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   567 May 31  2025 flake.lock\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1229 May 31  2025 flake.nix\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 20 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 31 10:04 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3469 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat\n/src/gpac/include/wince/errno.h\n/src/gpac/include/win32/inttypes.h\n/src/gpac/include/win32/stdint.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/nodes_svg.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/sync_layer.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/bitstream.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/route.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/list.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/network.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/path2d.h"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}], "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_DS9z8LFw76JNySj0ehQVixtF", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "cmd", "arguments": {"command": "cd /src/gpac && grep -n \"hevc_parse_vps_extension\" -n src/media_tools/av_parsers.c && sed -n '7650,7775p' src/media_tools/av_parsers.c"}}}], "error": null, "model_output_message": {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"_type": "ChatCompletionMessageToolCall"}], "raw": {"_type": "ModelResponse", "id": "chatcmpl-CsnMSolGV69zX1Jgij7jWYweYZHJL", "created": 1767175492, "model": "gpt-5.2-2025-12-11", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"_type": "Choices", "finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"_type": "Message", "content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"_type": "ChatCompletionMessageToolCall"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "_response_ms": 1338.071}, "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 4782, "output_tokens": 90, "total_tokens": 4872, "cost": 0.008676499999999998}}, "model_output": null, "code_action": null, "observations": "7689:static Bool hevc_parse_vps_extension(HEVC_VPS *vps, GF_BitStream *bs)\n8095:\t\tres = hevc_parse_vps_extension(vps, bs);\n{\n\treturn lhvc_get_scalability_id(vps, vps->layer_id_in_vps[id], LHVC_VIEW_ORDER_INDEX);\n}\n\nstatic u32 lhvc_get_num_views(HEVC_VPS *vps)\n{\n\tu32 numViews = 1, i;\n\tfor (i = 0;

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_LdOV3inO9BqfUWkYEqaajmLV', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac && find /src/gpac -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 348\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 31 10:04 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   747 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 70426 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 87490 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   567 May 31  2025 flake.lock\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1229 May 31  2025 flake.nix\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 20 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 31 10:04 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3469 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat\n/src/gpac/include/wince/errno.h\n/src/gpac/include/win32/inttypes.h\n/src/gpac/include/win32/stdint.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/nodes_svg.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/sync_layer.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/bitstream.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/route.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/list.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/network.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/path2d.h"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_DS9z8LFw76JNySj0ehQVixtF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'cd /src/gpac && grep -n \"hevc_parse_vps_extension\" -n src/media_tools/av_parsers.c && sed -n \\'7650,7775p\\' src/media_tools/av_parsers.c'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n7689:static Bool hevc_parse_vps_extension(HEVC_VPS *vps, GF_BitStream *bs)\n8095:\t\tres = hevc_parse_vps_extension(vps, bs);\n{\n\treturn lhvc_get_scalability_id(vps, vps->layer_id_in_vps[id], LHVC_VIEW_ORDER_INDEX);\n}\n\nstatic u32 lhvc_get_num_views(HEVC_VPS *vps)\n{\n\tu32 numViews = 1, i;\n\tfor (i = 0;

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_LdOV3inO9BqfUWkYEqaajmLV', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac && find /src/gpac -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 348\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 31 10:04 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   747 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 70426 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 87490 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   567 May 31  2025 flake.lock\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1229 May 31  2025 flake.nix\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 20 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 31 10:04 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3469 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat\n/src/gpac/include/wince/errno.h\n/src/gpac/include/win32/inttypes.h\n/src/gpac/include/win32/stdint.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/nodes_svg.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/sync_layer.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/bitstream.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/route.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/list.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/network.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/path2d.h"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_DS9z8LFw76JNySj0ehQVixtF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'cd /src/gpac && grep -n \"hevc_parse_vps_extension\" -n src/media_tools/av_parsers.c && sed -n \\'7650,7775p\\' src/media_tools/av_parsers.c'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n7689:static Bool hevc_parse_vps_extension(HEVC_VPS *vps, GF_BitStream *bs)\n8095:\t\tres = hevc_parse_vps_extension(vps, bs);\n{\n\treturn lhvc_get_scalability_id(vps, vps->layer_id_in_vps[id], LHVC_VIEW_ORDER_INDEX);\n}\n\nstatic u32 lhvc_get_num_views(HEVC_VPS *vps)\n{\n\tu32 numViews = 1, i;\n\tfor (i = 0;

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content":

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_LdOV3inO9BqfUWkYEqaajmLV', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac && find /src/gpac -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 348\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 31 10:04 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   747 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 70426 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 87490 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   567 May 31  2025 flake.lock\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1229 May 31  2025 flake.nix\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 20 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 31 10:04 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3469 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat\n/src/gpac/include/wince/errno.h\n/src/gpac/include/win32/inttypes.h\n/src/gpac/include/win32/stdint.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/nodes_svg.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/sync_layer.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/bitstream.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/route.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/list.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/network.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/path2d.h"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_DS9z8LFw76JNySj0ehQVixtF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'cd /src/gpac && grep -n \"hevc_parse_vps_extension\" -n src/media_tools/av_parsers.c && sed -n \\'7650,7775p\\' src/media_tools/av_parsers.c'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n7689:static Bool hevc_parse_vps_extension(HEVC_VPS *vps, GF_BitStream *bs)\n8095:\t\tres = hevc_parse_vps_extension(vps, bs);\n{\n\treturn lhvc_get_scalability_id(vps, vps->layer_id_in_vps[id], LHVC_VIEW_ORDER_INDEX);\n}\n\nstatic u32 lhvc_get_num_views(HEVC_VPS *vps)\n{\n\tu32 numViews = 1, i;\n\tfor (i = 0; i < vps->max_layers; i++) {\n\t\tu32 layer_id = vps->layer_id_in_nuh[i];\n\t\tif (i > 0 && (lhvc_get_view_index(vps, layer_id) != lhvc_get_scalability_id(vps, i -

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/gpac\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/gpac`.

help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the `/src/gpac` directory to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.\n\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/gpac` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_LdOV3inO9BqfUWkYEqaajmLV', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'ls -la /src/gpac && find /src/gpac -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 348\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Dec 31 10:04 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  4096 May 31  2025 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .git\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   427 May 31  2025 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   747 May 31  2025 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   120 May 31  2025 .gitmodules\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4786 May 31  2025 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 26428 May 31  2025 COPYING\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 70426 May 31  2025 Changelog\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root 13245 May 31  2025 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  7974 May 31  2025 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1267 May 31  2025 SECURITY.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 root root  4096 May 31  2025 applications\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root root  4096 May 31  2025 build\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  2046 May 31  2025 change_version.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   998 May 31  2025 check_revision.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 87490 May 31  2025 configure\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 debian\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 extra_lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root   567 May 31  2025 flake.lock\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1229 May 31  2025 flake.nix\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3935 May 31  2025 generate_installer.bat\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  2949 May 31  2025 gpac.spec\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 May 31  2025 include\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root    37 May 31  2025 manifest.rc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4395 May 31  2025 mkdmg.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 20 root root  4096 May 31  2025 modules\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 May 31  2025 packagers\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   742 May 31  2025 run_configure.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 root root  4096 May 31  2025 share\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Dec 31 10:04 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 root root  4096 May 31  2025 src\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3469 May 31  2025 static.mak\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 May 31  2025 testsuite\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1116 May 31  2025 version.bat\n/src/gpac/include/wince/errno.h\n/src/gpac/include/win32/inttypes.h\n/src/gpac/include/win32/stdint.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/nodes_svg.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/sync_layer.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/bitstream.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/route.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/list.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/network.h\n/src/gpac/include/gpac/path2d.h"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_DS9z8LFw76JNySj0ehQVixtF', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'cd /src/gpac && grep -n \"hevc_parse_vps_extension\" -n src/media_tools/av_parsers.c && sed -n \\'7650,7775p\\' src/media_tools/av_parsers.c'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n7689:static Bool hevc_parse_vps_extension(HEVC_VPS *vps, GF_BitStream *bs)\n8095:\t\tres = hevc_parse_vps_extension(vps, bs);\n{\n\treturn lhvc_get_scalability_id(vps, vps->layer_id_in_vps[id], LHVC_VIEW_ORDER_INDEX);\n}\n\nstatic u32 lhvc_get_num_views(HEVC_VPS *vps)\n{\n\tu32 numViews = 1, i;\n\tfor (i = 0; i < vps->max_layers; i++) {\n\t\tu32 layer_id = vps->layer_id_in_nuh[i];\n\t\tif (i > 0 && (lhvc_get_view_index(vps, layer_id) != lhvc_get_scalability_id(vps, i -
