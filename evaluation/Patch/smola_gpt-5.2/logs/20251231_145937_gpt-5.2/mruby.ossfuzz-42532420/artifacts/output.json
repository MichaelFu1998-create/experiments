{"output": "Implemented a bounds-safe substring search in `src/string.c` to prevent heap-buffer-overflow in `mrb_memsearch_ss`.\n\n## Root cause\n`mrb_memsearch_ss` scanned the haystack in word-sized steps and unconditionally dereferenced two word pointers (`s0` and `s1 = ys+m-1`) for each iteration. Near the end of the haystack, this caused an 8-byte read past the allocated buffer.\n\n## Fix\nUpdated `mrb_memsearch_ss` to:\n- Compute the last valid match start (`limit = n - m + 1`).\n- Restrict the SIMD/word loop to positions where the word reads are guaranteed in-bounds (`i + sizeof(bitint) <= limit`).\n- Add a safe bytewise tail scan for the remaining positions.\n\nThis keeps performance for the bulk of the search while guaranteeing no out-of-bounds reads.\n\n## Verification\n- `secb build`: succeeded.\n- `secb repro`: exits 0; sanitizer error no longer triggers.\n\n### Modified file\n- `/src/mruby/src/string.c` (minimal targeted change in `mrb_memsearch_ss`).", "steps": [{"task": "<uploaded_files>\n/src/mruby\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/mruby`.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\n<uploaded_files>\n/src/mruby\n</uploaded_files>\nI've uploaded a code repository in the directory `/src/mruby`.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning.

calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9Sqof9HnhT8vVquDRZ97FX2K', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/mruby && find /src/mruby -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 328\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     95 Nov 19 07:19 .dockerignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    691 Nov 19 07:19 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    205 Nov 19 07:19 .git-blame-ignore-revs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     84 Nov 19 07:18 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    329 Nov 19 07:19 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2723 Nov 19 07:19 .pre-commit-config.yaml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     30 Nov 19 07:18 .prettierrc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    130 Nov 19 07:19 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    293 Nov 19 07:18 .yardopts\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  11059 Nov 19 07:19 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     10 Nov 19 07:19 CODEOWNERS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6754 Nov 19 07:19 CONTRIBUTING.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    341 Nov 19 07:19 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 121845 Nov 19 07:19 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    120 Nov 19 07:18 Gemfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    373 Nov 19 07:19 Gemfile.lock\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2839 Nov 19 07:19 LEGAL\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1061 Nov 19 07:18 LICENSE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    529 Nov 19 07:19 Makefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5916 Nov 19 07:19 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4485 Nov 19 07:19 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2392 Nov 19 07:19 Rakefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    554 Nov 19 07:19 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    333 Nov 19 07:19 TODO.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1866 Nov 19 07:19 appveyor.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 benchmark\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 build_config\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    570 Nov 19 07:18 build_config.rb\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     89 Nov 19 07:19 codespell.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    301 Nov 19 07:19 docker-compose.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 lib\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     39 Nov 19 07:18 minirake\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrbgems\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrblib\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    595 Nov 19 07:19 mruby-source.gemspec\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 oss-fuzz\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 tasks\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 test\n/src/mruby/NEWS\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/lockfile.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/presym.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/gem.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/build.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/core_ext.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/doc.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/source.rb\n/src/mruby/.dockerignore\n/src/mruby/test/assert.rb"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_0ynJywquE9BAaT8tsNH3Iy6Q', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'sed -n \"560,720p\" /src/mruby/src/string.c\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_C3YWgKfvqnzWg1rxAtA6CDnC', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch(\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_pPwX0XVrrdGY8PpJZ4IoWoW6', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch_ss\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c /src/mruby/src | head -n 50\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_yqjkUNQYq8wMNVhXBnHmHPnO', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_str_split_m\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n#else\n#define RSTRING_CHAR_LEN(s) RSTRING_LEN(s)\n#define chars2bytes(s, off, ci) (ci)\n#define bytes2chars(s, bi) (bi)\n#define char_adjust(beg, end, ptr) (ptr)\n#define char_backtrack(ptr, end) ((end) - 1)\n#define str_index_str_by_char(mrb, str, sub, pos) str_index_str((mrb), (str), (sub), (pos))\n#endif\n\n/* The function is taken from http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-strfind.html */\n/* The original source code is under 2-clause BSD license;

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9Sqof9HnhT8vVquDRZ97FX2K', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/mruby && find /src/mruby -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 328\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     95 Nov 19 07:19 .dockerignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    691 Nov 19 07:19 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    205 Nov 19 07:19 .git-blame-ignore-revs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     84 Nov 19 07:18 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    329 Nov 19 07:19 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2723 Nov 19 07:19 .pre-commit-config.yaml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     30 Nov 19 07:18 .prettierrc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    130 Nov 19 07:19 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    293 Nov 19 07:18 .yardopts\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  11059 Nov 19 07:19 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     10 Nov 19 07:19 CODEOWNERS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6754 Nov 19 07:19 CONTRIBUTING.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    341 Nov 19 07:19 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 121845 Nov 19 07:19 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    120 Nov 19 07:18 Gemfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    373 Nov 19 07:19 Gemfile.lock\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2839 Nov 19 07:19 LEGAL\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1061 Nov 19 07:18 LICENSE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    529 Nov 19 07:19 Makefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5916 Nov 19 07:19 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4485 Nov 19 07:19 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2392 Nov 19 07:19 Rakefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    554 Nov 19 07:19 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    333 Nov 19 07:19 TODO.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1866 Nov 19 07:19 appveyor.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 benchmark\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 build_config\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    570 Nov 19 07:18 build_config.rb\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     89 Nov 19 07:19 codespell.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    301 Nov 19 07:19 docker-compose.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 lib\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     39 Nov 19 07:18 minirake\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrbgems\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrblib\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    595 Nov 19 07:19 mruby-source.gemspec\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 oss-fuzz\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 tasks\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 test\n/src/mruby/NEWS\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/lockfile.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/presym.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/gem.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/build.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/core_ext.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/doc.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/source.rb\n/src/mruby/.dockerignore\n/src/mruby/test/assert.rb"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_0ynJywquE9BAaT8tsNH3Iy6Q', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'sed -n \"560,720p\" /src/mruby/src/string.c\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_C3YWgKfvqnzWg1rxAtA6CDnC', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch(\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_pPwX0XVrrdGY8PpJZ4IoWoW6', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch_ss\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c /src/mruby/src | head -n 50\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_yqjkUNQYq8wMNVhXBnHmHPnO', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_str_split_m\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n#else\n#define RSTRING_CHAR_LEN(s) RSTRING_LEN(s)\n#define chars2bytes(s, off, ci) (ci)\n#define bytes2chars(s, bi) (bi)\n#define char_adjust(beg, end, ptr) (ptr)\n#define char_backtrack(ptr, end) ((end) - 1)\n#define str_index_str_by_char(mrb, str, sub, pos) str_index_str((mrb), (str), (sub), (pos))\n#endif\n\n/* The function is taken from http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-strfind.html */\n/* The original source code is under 2-clause BSD license;

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9Sqof9HnhT8vVquDRZ97FX2K', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/mruby && find /src/mruby -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 328\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     95 Nov 19 07:19 .dockerignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    691 Nov 19 07:19 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    205 Nov 19 07:19 .git-blame-ignore-revs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     84 Nov 19 07:18 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    329 Nov 19 07:19 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2723 Nov 19 07:19 .pre-commit-config.yaml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     30 Nov 19 07:18 .prettierrc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    130 Nov 19 07:19 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    293 Nov 19 07:18 .yardopts\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  11059 Nov 19 07:19 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     10 Nov 19 07:19 CODEOWNERS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6754 Nov 19 07:19 CONTRIBUTING.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    341 Nov 19 07:19 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 121845 Nov 19 07:19 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    120 Nov 19 07:18 Gemfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    373 Nov 19 07:19 Gemfile.lock\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2839 Nov 19 07:19 LEGAL\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1061 Nov 19 07:18 LICENSE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    529 Nov 19 07:19 Makefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5916 Nov 19 07:19 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4485 Nov 19 07:19 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2392 Nov 19 07:19 Rakefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    554 Nov 19 07:19 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    333 Nov 19 07:19 TODO.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1866 Nov 19 07:19 appveyor.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 benchmark\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 build_config\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    570 Nov 19 07:18 build_config.rb\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     89 Nov 19 07:19 codespell.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    301 Nov 19 07:19 docker-compose.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 lib\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     39 Nov 19 07:18 minirake\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrbgems\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrblib\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    595 Nov 19 07:19 mruby-source.gemspec\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 oss-fuzz\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 tasks\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 test\n/src/mruby/NEWS\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/lockfile.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/presym.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/gem.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/build.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/core_ext.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/doc.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/source.rb\n/src/mruby/.dockerignore\n/src/mruby/test/assert.rb"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_0ynJywquE9BAaT8tsNH3Iy6Q', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'sed -n \"560,720p\" /src/mruby/src/string.c\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_C3YWgKfvqnzWg1rxAtA6CDnC', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch(\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_pPwX0XVrrdGY8PpJZ4IoWoW6', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch_ss\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c /src/mruby/src | head -n 50\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_yqjkUNQYq8wMNVhXBnHmHPnO', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_str_split_m\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n#else\n#define RSTRING_CHAR_LEN(s) RSTRING_LEN(s)\n#define chars2bytes(s, off, ci) (ci)\n#define bytes2chars(s, bi) (bi)\n#define char_adjust(beg, end, ptr) (ptr)\n#define char_backtrack(ptr, end) ((end) - 1)\n#define str_index_str_by_char(mrb, str, sub, pos) str_index_str((mrb), (str), (sub), (pos))\n#endif\n\n/* The function is taken from http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-strfind.html */\n/* The original source code is under 2-clause BSD license;

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

You only have access to these tools:\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['*'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- cmd: Execute a shell command inside the current environment and return stdout, stderr, and exit code.\n    Takes inputs: {'command': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The shell command to execute (will be run via bash -lc).'}, 'base_dir': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional base directory to run the command in.', 'nullable': True}, 'timeout': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optional timeout in seconds (default 120).', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9Sqof9HnhT8vVquDRZ97FX2K', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/mruby && find /src/mruby -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 328\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     95 Nov 19 07:19 .dockerignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    691 Nov 19 07:19 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    205 Nov 19 07:19 .git-blame-ignore-revs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     84 Nov 19 07:18 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    329 Nov 19 07:19 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2723 Nov 19 07:19 .pre-commit-config.yaml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     30 Nov 19 07:18 .prettierrc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    130 Nov 19 07:19 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    293 Nov 19 07:18 .yardopts\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  11059 Nov 19 07:19 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     10 Nov 19 07:19 CODEOWNERS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6754 Nov 19 07:19 CONTRIBUTING.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    341 Nov 19 07:19 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 121845 Nov 19 07:19 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    120 Nov 19 07:18 Gemfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    373 Nov 19 07:19 Gemfile.lock\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2839 Nov 19 07:19 LEGAL\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1061 Nov 19 07:18 LICENSE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    529 Nov 19 07:19 Makefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5916 Nov 19 07:19 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4485 Nov 19 07:19 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2392 Nov 19 07:19 Rakefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    554 Nov 19 07:19 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    333 Nov 19 07:19 TODO.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1866 Nov 19 07:19 appveyor.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 benchmark\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 build_config\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    570 Nov 19 07:18 build_config.rb\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     89 Nov 19 07:19 codespell.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    301 Nov 19 07:19 docker-compose.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 lib\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     39 Nov 19 07:18 minirake\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrbgems\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrblib\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    595 Nov 19 07:19 mruby-source.gemspec\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 oss-fuzz\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 tasks\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 test\n/src/mruby/NEWS\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/lockfile.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/presym.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/gem.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/build.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/core_ext.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/doc.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/source.rb\n/src/mruby/.dockerignore\n/src/mruby/test/assert.rb"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_0ynJywquE9BAaT8tsNH3Iy6Q', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'sed -n \"560,720p\" /src/mruby/src/string.c\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_C3YWgKfvqnzWg1rxAtA6CDnC', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch(\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_pPwX0XVrrdGY8PpJZ4IoWoW6', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch_ss\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c /src/mruby/src | head -n 50\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_yqjkUNQYq8wMNVhXBnHmHPnO', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_str_split_m\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n#else\n#define RSTRING_CHAR_LEN(s) RSTRING_LEN(s)\n#define chars2bytes(s, off, ci) (ci)\n#define bytes2chars(s, bi) (bi)\n#define char_adjust(beg, end, ptr) (ptr)\n#define char_backtrack(ptr, end) ((end) - 1)\n#define str_index_str_by_char(mrb, str, sub, pos) str_index_str((mrb), (str), (sub), (pos))\n#endif\n\n/* The function is taken from http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-strfind.html */\n/* The original source code is under 2-clause BSD license;

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9Sqof9HnhT8vVquDRZ97FX2K', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/mruby && find /src/mruby -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 328\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     95 Nov 19 07:19 .dockerignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    691 Nov 19 07:19 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    205 Nov 19 07:19 .git-blame-ignore-revs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     84 Nov 19 07:18 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    329 Nov 19 07:19 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2723 Nov 19 07:19 .pre-commit-config.yaml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     30 Nov 19 07:18 .prettierrc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    130 Nov 19 07:19 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    293 Nov 19 07:18 .yardopts\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  11059 Nov 19 07:19 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     10 Nov 19 07:19 CODEOWNERS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6754 Nov 19 07:19 CONTRIBUTING.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    341 Nov 19 07:19 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 121845 Nov 19 07:19 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    120 Nov 19 07:18 Gemfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    373 Nov 19 07:19 Gemfile.lock\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2839 Nov 19 07:19 LEGAL\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1061 Nov 19 07:18 LICENSE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    529 Nov 19 07:19 Makefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5916 Nov 19 07:19 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4485 Nov 19 07:19 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2392 Nov 19 07:19 Rakefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    554 Nov 19 07:19 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    333 Nov 19 07:19 TODO.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1866 Nov 19 07:19 appveyor.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 benchmark\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 build_config\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    570 Nov 19 07:18 build_config.rb\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     89 Nov 19 07:19 codespell.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    301 Nov 19 07:19 docker-compose.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 lib\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     39 Nov 19 07:18 minirake\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrbgems\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrblib\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    595 Nov 19 07:19 mruby-source.gemspec\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 oss-fuzz\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 tasks\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 test\n/src/mruby/NEWS\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/lockfile.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/presym.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/gem.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/build.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/core_ext.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/doc.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/source.rb\n/src/mruby/.dockerignore\n/src/mruby/test/assert.rb"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_0ynJywquE9BAaT8tsNH3Iy6Q', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'sed -n \"560,720p\" /src/mruby/src/string.c\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_C3YWgKfvqnzWg1rxAtA6CDnC', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch(\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_pPwX0XVrrdGY8PpJZ4IoWoW6', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch_ss\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c /src/mruby/src | head -n 50\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_yqjkUNQYq8wMNVhXBnHmHPnO', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_str_split_m\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n#else\n#define RSTRING_CHAR_LEN(s) RSTRING_LEN(s)\n#define chars2bytes(s, off, ci) (ci)\n#define bytes2chars(s, bi) (bi)\n#define char_adjust(beg, end, ptr) (ptr)\n#define char_backtrack(ptr, end) ((end) - 1)\n#define str_index_str_by_char(mrb, str, sub, pos) str_index_str((mrb), (str), (sub), (pos))\n#endif\n\n/* The function is taken from http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-strfind.html */\n/* The original source code is under 2-clause BSD license;

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9Sqof9HnhT8vVquDRZ97FX2K', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/mruby && find /src/mruby -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 328\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     95 Nov 19 07:19 .dockerignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    691 Nov 19 07:19 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    205 Nov 19 07:19 .git-blame-ignore-revs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     84 Nov 19 07:18 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    329 Nov 19 07:19 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2723 Nov 19 07:19 .pre-commit-config.yaml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     30 Nov 19 07:18 .prettierrc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    130 Nov 19 07:19 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    293 Nov 19 07:18 .yardopts\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  11059 Nov 19 07:19 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     10 Nov 19 07:19 CODEOWNERS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6754 Nov 19 07:19 CONTRIBUTING.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    341 Nov 19 07:19 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 121845 Nov 19 07:19 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    120 Nov 19 07:18 Gemfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    373 Nov 19 07:19 Gemfile.lock\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2839 Nov 19 07:19 LEGAL\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1061 Nov 19 07:18 LICENSE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    529 Nov 19 07:19 Makefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5916 Nov 19 07:19 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4485 Nov 19 07:19 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2392 Nov 19 07:19 Rakefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    554 Nov 19 07:19 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    333 Nov 19 07:19 TODO.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1866 Nov 19 07:19 appveyor.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 benchmark\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 build_config\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    570 Nov 19 07:18 build_config.rb\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     89 Nov 19 07:19 codespell.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    301 Nov 19 07:19 docker-compose.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 lib\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     39 Nov 19 07:18 minirake\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrbgems\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrblib\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    595 Nov 19 07:19 mruby-source.gemspec\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 oss-fuzz\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 tasks\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 test\n/src/mruby/NEWS\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/lockfile.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/presym.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/gem.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/build.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/core_ext.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/doc.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/source.rb\n/src/mruby/.dockerignore\n/src/mruby/test/assert.rb"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_0ynJywquE9BAaT8tsNH3Iy6Q', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'sed -n \"560,720p\" /src/mruby/src/string.c\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_C3YWgKfvqnzWg1rxAtA6CDnC', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch(\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_pPwX0XVrrdGY8PpJZ4IoWoW6', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch_ss\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c /src/mruby/src | head -n 50\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_yqjkUNQYq8wMNVhXBnHmHPnO', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_str_split_m\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n#else\n#define RSTRING_CHAR_LEN(s) RSTRING_LEN(s)\n#define chars2bytes(s, off, ci) (ci)\n#define bytes2chars(s, bi) (bi)\n#define char_adjust(beg, end, ptr) (ptr)\n#define char_backtrack(ptr, end) ((end) - 1)\n#define str_index_str_by_char(mrb, str, sub, pos) str_index_str((mrb), (str), (sub), (pos))\n#endif\n\n/* The function is taken from http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-strfind.html */\n/* The original source code is under 2-clause BSD license;

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9Sqof9HnhT8vVquDRZ97FX2K', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/mruby && find /src/mruby -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 328\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     95 Nov 19 07:19 .dockerignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    691 Nov 19 07:19 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    205 Nov 19 07:19 .git-blame-ignore-revs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     84 Nov 19 07:18 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    329 Nov 19 07:19 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2723 Nov 19 07:19 .pre-commit-config.yaml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     30 Nov 19 07:18 .prettierrc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    130 Nov 19 07:19 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    293 Nov 19 07:18 .yardopts\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  11059 Nov 19 07:19 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     10 Nov 19 07:19 CODEOWNERS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6754 Nov 19 07:19 CONTRIBUTING.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    341 Nov 19 07:19 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 121845 Nov 19 07:19 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    120 Nov 19 07:18 Gemfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    373 Nov 19 07:19 Gemfile.lock\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2839 Nov 19 07:19 LEGAL\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1061 Nov 19 07:18 LICENSE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    529 Nov 19 07:19 Makefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5916 Nov 19 07:19 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4485 Nov 19 07:19 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2392 Nov 19 07:19 Rakefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    554 Nov 19 07:19 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    333 Nov 19 07:19 TODO.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1866 Nov 19 07:19 appveyor.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 benchmark\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 build_config\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    570 Nov 19 07:18 build_config.rb\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     89 Nov 19 07:19 codespell.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    301 Nov 19 07:19 docker-compose.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 lib\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     39 Nov 19 07:18 minirake\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrbgems\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrblib\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    595 Nov 19 07:19 mruby-source.gemspec\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 oss-fuzz\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 tasks\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 test\n/src/mruby/NEWS\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/lockfile.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/presym.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/gem.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/build.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/core_ext.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/doc.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/source.rb\n/src/mruby/.dockerignore\n/src/mruby/test/assert.rb"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_0ynJywquE9BAaT8tsNH3Iy6Q', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'sed -n \"560,720p\" /src/mruby/src/string.c\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_C3YWgKfvqnzWg1rxAtA6CDnC', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch(\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_pPwX0XVrrdGY8PpJZ4IoWoW6', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch_ss\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c /src/mruby/src | head -n 50\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_yqjkUNQYq8wMNVhXBnHmHPnO', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_str_split_m\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n#else\n#define RSTRING_CHAR_LEN(s) RSTRING_LEN(s)\n#define chars2bytes(s, off, ci) (ci)\n#define bytes2chars(s, bi) (bi)\n#define char_adjust(beg, end, ptr) (ptr)\n#define char_backtrack(ptr, end) ((end) - 1)\n#define str_index_str_by_char(mrb, str, sub, pos) str_index_str((mrb), (str), (sub), (pos))\n#endif\n\n/* The function is taken from http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-strfind.html */\n/* The original source code is under 2-clause BSD license;

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9Sqof9HnhT8vVquDRZ97FX2K', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/mruby && find /src/mruby -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 328\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     95 Nov 19 07:19 .dockerignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    691 Nov 19 07:19 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    205 Nov 19 07:19 .git-blame-ignore-revs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     84 Nov 19 07:18 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    329 Nov 19 07:19 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2723 Nov 19 07:19 .pre-commit-config.yaml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     30 Nov 19 07:18 .prettierrc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    130 Nov 19 07:19 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    293 Nov 19 07:18 .yardopts\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  11059 Nov 19 07:19 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     10 Nov 19 07:19 CODEOWNERS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6754 Nov 19 07:19 CONTRIBUTING.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    341 Nov 19 07:19 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 121845 Nov 19 07:19 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    120 Nov 19 07:18 Gemfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    373 Nov 19 07:19 Gemfile.lock\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2839 Nov 19 07:19 LEGAL\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1061 Nov 19 07:18 LICENSE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    529 Nov 19 07:19 Makefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5916 Nov 19 07:19 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4485 Nov 19 07:19 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2392 Nov 19 07:19 Rakefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    554 Nov 19 07:19 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    333 Nov 19 07:19 TODO.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1866 Nov 19 07:19 appveyor.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 benchmark\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 build_config\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    570 Nov 19 07:18 build_config.rb\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     89 Nov 19 07:19 codespell.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    301 Nov 19 07:19 docker-compose.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 lib\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     39 Nov 19 07:18 minirake\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrbgems\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrblib\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    595 Nov 19 07:19 mruby-source.gemspec\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 oss-fuzz\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 tasks\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 test\n/src/mruby/NEWS\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/lockfile.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/presym.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/gem.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/build.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/core_ext.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/doc.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/source.rb\n/src/mruby/.dockerignore\n/src/mruby/test/assert.rb"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_0ynJywquE9BAaT8tsNH3Iy6Q', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'sed -n \"560,720p\" /src/mruby/src/string.c\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_C3YWgKfvqnzWg1rxAtA6CDnC', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch(\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_pPwX0XVrrdGY8PpJZ4IoWoW6', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch_ss\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c /src/mruby/src | head -n 50\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_yqjkUNQYq8wMNVhXBnHmHPnO', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_str_split_m\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n#else\n#define RSTRING_CHAR_LEN(s) RSTRING_LEN(s)\n#define chars2bytes(s, off, ci) (ci)\n#define bytes2chars(s, bi) (bi)\n#define char_adjust(beg, end, ptr) (ptr)\n#define char_backtrack(ptr, end) ((end) - 1)\n#define str_index_str_by_char(mrb, str, sub, pos) str_index_str((mrb), (str), (sub), (pos))\n#endif\n\n/* The function is taken from http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-strfind.html */\n/* The original source code is under 2-clause BSD license;

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.\n   - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description\n   - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase\n   - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies\n   - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages\n\n2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.\n   - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability\n   - Consider trade-offs between different solutions\n   - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability\n   - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues\n\n4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   - Change to the `/src/mruby` directory\n   - Run `secb build` to build the project and check for compilation errors\n   - If compilation succeeds, run `secb repro` to verify the fix prevents the crash\n   - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented\n   - **IMPORTANT: Keep iterating until `secb repro` confirms that the sanitizer error is NOT triggered. This is the success criterion.**\n\n5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.\n   - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability\n   - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue\n   - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced\n\n**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: Your implementation is successful only when `secb repro` runs without triggering any sanitizer errors. Continue refining your solution until this criterion is met.\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9Sqof9HnhT8vVquDRZ97FX2K', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': \"bash -lc 'ls -la /src/mruby && find /src/mruby -maxdepth 3 -type f | head'\"}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\ntotal 328\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     95 Nov 19 07:19 .dockerignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    691 Nov 19 07:19 .editorconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    205 Nov 19 07:19 .git-blame-ignore-revs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     84 Nov 19 07:18 .gitattributes\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 .github\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    329 Nov 19 07:19 .gitignore\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2723 Nov 19 07:19 .pre-commit-config.yaml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     30 Nov 19 07:18 .prettierrc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    130 Nov 19 07:19 .travis.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    293 Nov 19 07:18 .yardopts\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  11059 Nov 19 07:19 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     10 Nov 19 07:19 CODEOWNERS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6754 Nov 19 07:19 CONTRIBUTING.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    341 Nov 19 07:19 Dockerfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 121845 Nov 19 07:19 Doxyfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    120 Nov 19 07:18 Gemfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    373 Nov 19 07:19 Gemfile.lock\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2839 Nov 19 07:19 LEGAL\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1061 Nov 19 07:18 LICENSE\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    529 Nov 19 07:19 Makefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5916 Nov 19 07:19 NEWS\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4485 Nov 19 07:19 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2392 Nov 19 07:19 Rakefile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    554 Nov 19 07:19 SECURITY.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    333 Nov 19 07:19 TODO.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1866 Nov 19 07:19 appveyor.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 benchmark\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 build_config\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    570 Nov 19 07:18 build_config.rb\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     89 Nov 19 07:19 codespell.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 doc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    301 Nov 19 07:19 docker-compose.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 examples\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 include\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 lib\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     39 Nov 19 07:18 minirake\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrbgems\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 mrblib\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    595 Nov 19 07:19 mruby-source.gemspec\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:18 oss-fuzz\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Jan 22 05:35 smolagents_src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 tasks\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Nov 19 07:19 test\n/src/mruby/NEWS\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/lockfile.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/presym.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/gem.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/build.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/core_ext.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/doc.rb\n/src/mruby/lib/mruby/source.rb\n/src/mruby/.dockerignore\n/src/mruby/test/assert.rb"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_0ynJywquE9BAaT8tsNH3Iy6Q', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'sed -n \"560,720p\" /src/mruby/src/string.c\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_C3YWgKfvqnzWg1rxAtA6CDnC', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch(\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_pPwX0XVrrdGY8PpJZ4IoWoW6', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_memsearch_ss\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c /src/mruby/src | head -n 50\\''}}}, {'id': 'call_yqjkUNQYq8wMNVhXBnHmHPnO', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'cmd', 'arguments': {'command': 'bash -lc \\'grep -R \"mrb_str_split_m\" -n /src/mruby/src/string.c | head\\''}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n#else\n#define RSTRING_CHAR_LEN(s) RSTRING_LEN(s)\n#define chars2bytes(s, off, ci) (ci)\n#define bytes2chars(s, bi) (bi)\n#define char_adjust(beg, end, ptr) (ptr)\n#define char_backtrack(ptr, end) ((end) - 1)\n#define str_index_str_by_char(mrb, str, sub, pos) str_index_str((mrb), (str), (sub), (pos))\n#endif\n\n/* The function is taken from http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-strfind.html */\n/* The original source code is under 2-clause BSD license;
